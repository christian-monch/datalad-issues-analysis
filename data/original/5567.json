I thought `datalad save SUBDATASET` would save the latest commit of the subdataset located in folder `SUBDATASET`. But here is what happens:\r\n```\r\n[dorian@mri fmriprep-20.2.x]$ datalad save -m 'Update fmriprep reference' fmriprep\r\n[dorian@mri fmriprep-20.2.x]$ datalad save -m 'Update fmriprep reference' fmriprep/\r\n[dorian@mri fmriprep-20.2.x]$ datalad save -d . -m 'Update fmriprep reference' fmriprep\r\nadd(ok): fmriprep (file)\r\nsave(ok): . (dataset)\r\naction summary:\r\n  add (ok: 1)\r\n  save (ok: 1)\r\n[dorian@mri fmriprep-20.2.x]$ datalad status -r\r\nnothing to save, working tree clean\r\n```\r\nI was running `datalad status -r` to make sure the entire subdataset tree was clean. It showed that the subdataset `fmriprep` was modified. I tried to save it normally, and the prompt just returns, nothing was done. Running `datalad status -r` still showed it as modified. After placing `-d .` in the command, it actually saved it. Did I miss something on how it should work?\r\n\r\n#### What steps will reproduce the problem?\r\nNA\r\n\r\n#### What version of DataLad are you using (run `datalad --version`)? On what operating system (consider running `datalad wtf`)?\r\ndatalad 0.14.0\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Is there anything else that would be useful to know in this context?\r\nThese subdatasets were folders, thus I created the dataset with `--force`.\r\n\r\n#### Have you had any success using DataLad before?
