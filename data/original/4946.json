Yet, when working with collaborators becomes a hit and miss which commands requires `--sibling` (i.e., update) and which command needs `--source`. Both refer to the same underlying concept of a remote in git, if my understanding is correct. May I suggest you unify the sibling and source concepts, perhaps by making aliases of each other if you want to keep the compatibility with previous versions. \r\n\r\n#### What steps will reproduce the problem?\r\nNo need.\r\n\r\n#### What version of DataLad are you using (run `datalad --version`)? On what operating system (consider running `datalad wtf`)?\r\n0.13.1\r\n\r\n#### Is there anything else that would be useful to know in this context?\r\nno\r\n\r\n#### Have you had any success using DataLad before?
