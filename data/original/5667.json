This did not work reliably if the datalad command invoked subprocesses, and if asyncio-based subprocess were used. In the asyncio-based implementation processes would randomly wait forever on some synchronization primitive.\r\n\r\nMotivation: I am creating a *pipeline*/*orchestration* command for metalad that allows a user to specify an information source element, e.g. a dataset-traverser, and a number of processing elements, e.g. a metadata-extractor and a metadata-adder, which would be run on the output of the previous element. So the pipeline would look something like this:\r\n\r\n   [dataset-traverser->metadata-extractor->metadata-adder]\r\n\r\nAnd I would like to use concurrent.futures (or some other process-based parallelization) to distribute pipeline element processing to multiple cores.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR is marked as draft-pull request, since it changes a central piece of datalad, and since I did not yet test it on Windows or MacOS\r\n\r\nCloses #5422, #5409, #5100\r\n\r\nTODOs:\r\n- [x] docstrings for added functions\r\n- [x] add a `test_popen_invocation` from https://github.com/datalad/datalad/pull/5369/files#diff-4aa1a9688db72f7a475890e0ee6a343ea98af70ccc3bfa66f17da82c819dfa8dR230\r\n- [x] add an explicit test to verify its operation within an asyncio event_loop (ref  #5100)", "closed_by": {"login": "yarikoptic", "id": 39889, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjM5ODg5", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39889?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic", "html_url": "https://github.com/yarikoptic", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/5667/reactions", "total_count": 5, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 1, "hooray": 1, "confused": 0, "heart": 1, "rocket": 1, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/5667/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
