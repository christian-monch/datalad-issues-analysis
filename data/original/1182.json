That could slow things down a bit though then :-/ and pure -o SendEnv wouldn't be an acceptable  solution since requires sshd configuration to allow passing those variables (by default only locale settings are allowed to be passed).  So the only way I found to make it work is by prepending each invocation with explicit adjusted PATH:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n$> ssh -p 2221 172.17.0.2 'git --version'       \r\ngit version 2.1.4\r\n\r\n$> ssh -p 2221 172.17.0.2 'PATH=/usr/lib/git-annex.linux:/bin:/usr/bin git --version'     \r\ngit version 2.11.0\r\n```\r\n\r\nso in principle it is doable I guess and might be beneficial for some deployments... what do you think @mih and @bpoldrack ?\r\n\r\nedit 3:  so for now decided not to mess with the \"use bundled git on the remote end\" and since anyways we don't run tests on remote hosts (only on localhost, see #1183 for a wishlist), decided just to fix up tests to skip appropriately on localhosts having no up to date system-wide git (so pretty much retaining similar to before behavior).
