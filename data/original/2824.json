I can collaborate on datasets that would be too big to put contents into a Github repository (meaning .git) and alongside the .git repository create a git-annex that keeps a key/value store of the files themselves. Git annex, like git, has an understanding of a set of \"remotes\" - but these remotes are different because they can span from a USB stick to cloud storage. In the walkthrough for git-annex, it has me create a git repo too. Does this mean that the two are typically used alongside one another? If using git annex, would I issue commands to just git-annex and git, or just git-annex? \r\n - To really understand what is going on with datalad, I'd like to have an understanding of how it's using git and git annex (separately or together). Example commands would probably suffice here for what happens when you do each of datalads various commands.\r\n - It seems that .git + .git-annex is most of the underlying functionality, and datalad is the driver for useful tools like search, install, etc.? \r\n - Does datalad bring the entire metadata setup, or is this part of git annex too?\r\n  - Then why should a user interact with datalad as an additional dependency?\r\n - If I use datalad, and datalad eventually goes away, do I still get power to use git-annex? What do I lose? \r\n\r\n## What is a superdataset\r\nThe core of this question is:\r\n\r\n> How does Github relate to DataLad?\r\n\r\nDatalad (if I understand correctly) defines a superdataset as a collection of datasets, where each dataset is a folder with an annex in a github repository. It seems like this means we have one upper level git folder, and then each subfolder (a submodle?) has had the git-annex init called within. \r\n\r\n - This means that Github is being used for version control of git annex?\r\n -  There is no \"Github equivalent for just Git Annex\" outside of this? \r\n - If a user doesn't have datalad, how would a git-annex be shared or otherwise version controlled?\r\n - I want to understand how the [Github repository here](https://github.com/datalad/datasets.datalad.org) relates to files on some local machine, some storage, and then the [web interface here](http://datasets.datalad.org/?dir=/adhd200/RawDataBIDS/NeuroIMAGE). I want to understand this enough so I can answer the question **how do I create my own superdataset?**\r\n\r\nI did find datalad on the list of public repositories page (https://git-annex.branchable.com/publicrepos/) that somewhat suggested this last idea! \r\n\r\nSo looking at the Github repository for datalad superdataset, I see a bunch of folders with submodules to other folders, and a .datalad file and a bunch of meta.json (I think to describe the metadata for each linked folder?) Does this mean that the git-annex part is still not represented here, but used in some way by datalab to parse and then obtain the annex? What I don't understand is how this repository turns into the datalab portal where I can click through datasets. The underlying questions are \"How do I make this myself\" and \"how much of this is relying on datalab, vs, is just git annex?\" and \"how is git really involved aside from storing metadata about datalad?", "closed_by": {"login": "mih", "id": 136479, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjQ3OQ==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/136479?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih", "html_url": "https://github.com/mih", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/2824/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/2824/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
