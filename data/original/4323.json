Mostly, I've removed the word \"failed\". I've played around with \"downgrading\" the message from \"warning\" to \"info\", but I guess the color coding as a warning helps to not miss a problem should there ever be one. The text should make sure that this Warning is no need for worry if the remote is a pure Git remote. \r\n\r\nI think its better than the previous messages, but I'm not yet 100% satisfied. Here is how the message looks like for the situation described in #4322 \r\n\r\n```sh\r\ndatalad siblings add --name bitbucket --url https://testing_ittacc@bitbucket.org/testing_ittacc/mydataset.git\r\n[INFO   ] Could not enable annex remote bitbucket. This is expected if bitbucket is a pure Git remote, or happens if it is not accessible. \r\n[WARNING] Could not detect whether bitbucket carries an annex. If bitbucket is a pure Git remote, this is expected. Remote was marked by annex as annex-ignore. Edit .git/config to reset if you think that was done by mistake due to absent connection etc \r\n.: bitbucket(-) [https://testing_ittacc@bitbucket.org/testing_ittacc/mydataset.git (git)]\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf anyone has other suggestions, please say so. :)\r\n\r\nThis fixes #4322", "closed_by": {"login": "adswa", "id": 29738718, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI5NzM4NzE4", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29738718?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/adswa", "html_url": "https://github.com/adswa", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/adswa/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/adswa/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/adswa/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/adswa/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/adswa/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/adswa/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/adswa/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/adswa/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/adswa/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/4323/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/4323/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
