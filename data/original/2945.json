E.g. a json file which gives the analysis' inputs and outputs; those inputs/outputs that are files, would be given as git-annex keys, or as symlinks relative to the json file.  Analyses could be annotated with metadata, so one could find analyses by metadata.\r\nWorkflow engines like Cromwell can represent analyses ( https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/develop/api/RESTAPI/#get-workflow-and-call-level-metadata-for-a-specified-workflow ), but this representation is tied to the way an analysis was executed, e.g. paths to input/output files in a particular cloud.  It would be good to have a standardized representation of analyses that used git-annex keys or relative symlinks to abstract away such specifics.  Then can have datalad commands to re-run a (possibly modified) analysis in a specified cloud or locally, automatically putting the inputs into the right destination, and automatically registering results in git-annex (without necessarily downloading).  There'd need to be backends for different clouds and workflow engines, but then the user would have a simple uniform interface.\r\nIdeally, one would have something like DNAnexus ( https://wiki.dnanexus.com/api-specification-v1.0.0/introduction ) , but based on git-annex and without vendor lock-in.\r\nI've been writing something along these lines based on the Cromwell workflow manager, but thought I'd post the general thinking here for collective brainstorming.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/2945/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/2945/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
