When we do a local clone first it records local \"url\" within .gitmodules, requiring user to change it to a public one before publishing.  Not a big deal I guess, but still -- user needs to know to do that, how to do that (editor or not immediately obvious `git config --file .gitmodules --replace-all submodule.{name}.url {public_url}` followed by `save|commit`, etc.\r\n\r\nI think we should provide some convenience to streamline such use cases.\r\n\r\n#### Candidate approaches requiring development in DataLad:\r\n\r\n- approach 1: add a new option `clone [--use-sibling-url [NAME]]` which would  then work only for clones from local repos, and take their (tracked if no NAME provided) remote's URL as the url to use for `submodule.{}.url`\r\n\r\nI guess original url would be recorded in `submodule.{}.datalad-url` in a similar fashion to what is done for RIA remotes (only AFAIK) in https://github.com/datalad/datalad/blob/b4fafb048489019fc165e4e1f8b69e5bb40df008/datalad/core/distributed/clone.py#L357\r\n\r\nThen it would be\r\n\r\n```\r\ndatalad clone --use-sibling-url --reckless ephemeral ../orig sourcedata\r\n... do whatever\r\ndatalad push|publish\r\n```\r\n\r\n- approach 2: make it possible to \"add\" a sibling which would make current annex having a reckless/ephemeral .git/annex/objects, thus possibly mutating what it already has, then it would be\r\n\r\n```\r\ndatalad clone -d . public_url sourcedata\r\ndatalad siblings add -n local --reckless ephemeral ...\r\n... do whatever\r\ndatalad push|publish\r\n```\r\n\r\nwe also have ways to extend candidate urls via datalad-specific configuration in `.datalad/config` ([e.g as described in handbook](http://handbook.datalad.org/en/latest/beyond_basics/101-148-clonepriority.html?highlight=candidate#clone-candidates)) but I think it is not directly relevant, since I think it is a question of fixing `.gitmodules` `.{}.url` entries which aren't usable anywhere but locally in such local reckless clones cases.\r\n\r\nmay be there are better approaches, which might not even require extending our API?", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/5950/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/5950/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
