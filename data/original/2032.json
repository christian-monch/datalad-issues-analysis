Given that the `///` is not a viable beast to play with, I decided to take a few datasets from it, reaggregate them and re-published them (without data). I will use this to implement further tests. Moreover, I would be glad to get comments on the default behavior. I give a sample below. Please chime in with your feedback and suggestions.\r\n\r\nThe following protocol is what is possible after a plain reaggregation, without any change in the dataset configuration.\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n% datalad install -s http://psydata.ovgu.de/aggdemo/demo/ aggdemo\r\n[INFO   ] Cloning http://psydata.ovgu.de/aggdemo/demo/ to '/tmp/aggdemo' \r\n[INFO   ] access to dataset sibling \"psydata\" not auto-enabled, enable with:\r\n|               datalad siblings -d \"/tmp/aggdemo\" enable -s psydata \r\ninstall(ok): /tmp/aggdemo (dataset)\r\n% cd aggdemo\r\n% datalad search\r\n[INFO   ] Building search index \r\n[INFO   ] Scanning for metadata keys \r\n[INFO   ] Added 1 document on dataset . \r\n[INFO   ] Added 9457 documents on dataset crcns-vim-2 \r\n[INFO   ] Added 4 documents on dataset openfmri \r\n[INFO   ] Added 134 documents on dataset openfmri/ds000001 \r\n[INFO   ] Added 280 documents on dataset openfmri/ds000002 \r\n[INFO   ] Search index contains 9876 documents \r\n% datalad search nishimoto\r\n[INFO   ] Query completed in 0.00141906738281 sec.
