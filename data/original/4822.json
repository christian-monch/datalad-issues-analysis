But given historical stability and presence of those URLs in the wild already, it is very unlikely to happen\r\n\r\nPossible implementation:\r\n- datalad internally and also allowing extensions to register new \"URL mappers\"\r\n- such \"mappers\" possibly should allow for different/absent context/purpose behavior\r\n  - e.g. for OSF it would only matter for `clone`\r\n  - in a somewhat related (waiting for merge) #4816, where within datalad itself we introduce \"mapping\" of `shub://` URLs into (minted by singularity hub with timeouts) http urls so that those images could be downloaded from the singularity hub; context would be `download`\r\n- we already hardcode `///` to be a mapping to `http://datasets.datalad.org` -- implementation could generalize it\r\n- some mappers could be as simple as regex based transformation (like in the case of OSF, `///`)", "closed_by": {"login": "mih", "id": 136479, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjQ3OQ==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/136479?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih", "html_url": "https://github.com/mih", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/4822/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/4822/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
