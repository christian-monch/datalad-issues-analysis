(I thought we had an issue, yet to find it)\r\n\r\nThis pull request proposes to take advantage of the new feature in git-annex since today to be able to pass INFO level message to the git-annex, which then gets provided to us as well in --json output.  This way we could channel not only a dummy message that we need to download a tarball of size X, but also entire progress report for more progress bars appearing on the screen (for each tarball being downloaded).  ~~~It is a bit mouthfull on the screen, and not playing nicely with tqdm and probably expected sizes,  but it is better than silence of current implementation ;)~~~  Now it looks actually quite pretty, with progressbars being cleared if a log message is displayed, so the whole output is quite sensible!\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n- [x] This change is complete\r\n- [x] Force rerunning tests whenever new git-annex-standlone gets uploadedd -- now goes through local testing\r\n\r\nPlease have a look @datalad/developers\r\n", "closed_by": {"login": "yarikoptic", "id": 39889, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjM5ODg5", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39889?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic", "html_url": "https://github.com/yarikoptic", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/2120/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/2120/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
