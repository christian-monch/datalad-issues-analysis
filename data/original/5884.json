It seems to come out to be again yet another \"one time use locking helper\", but since we have not come up with a better way to address this locking \"issue\", I think it is a small price to pay ;)\r\n\r\n- [-] I have positioned against `maint` but it grew a bit too big.  I will be fine to reposition it against `master` -- we should get one out of the door soon.\r\n- [-] I wonder if I should add some randomization so that not all parallel processes which fail to acquire lock start asking for credentials at the same time ... ;-)", "closed_by": {"login": "yarikoptic", "id": 39889, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjM5ODg5", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39889?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic", "html_url": "https://github.com/yarikoptic", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/5884/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/5884/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
