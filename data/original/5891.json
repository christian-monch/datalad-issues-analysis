I was researching the different types of special remotes that are available and stumbled over `externaltype=datalad` and `externaltype=datalad-archives`. Together with `ora` those seem to be the ones explicitly implemented for datalad. Unfortunately, I could not find much information on the first two and am still not sure what they do, how they work and how all three relate to each other.\r\n\r\nI primarily found `externaltype=datalad{-archives}` used for datasets hosted on http://datasets.datalad.org/ but from my understanding it is not specific for that location. I am not sure in which cases these special remote types might be relevant and used.\r\n\r\nI guess this issue could be considered as a request for more documentation for those special remote types.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance! I am sorry if I overlooked an obvious part of documentation.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/5891/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/5891/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
