This is rather fragile (those could change at any point). I propose to add the subdataset's dataset UUID as a gitmodule property as well (on `install -d`, `add/rev-save -d`, and `create -d`). This will enable querying a dataset resolver in the future.\r\n\r\nHaving such additional identifying information also makes it more easy to work with dataset hierarchies without having to reflect the hierarchy composition 1:1 on the file system. This added flexbility will make it straighforward to build a **dataset-centric** view (as opposed to a directory-centric view like on http://datasets.datalad.org) of a large collection of datasets. Such as dataset-centric view (one page per dataset), is, for example, a precondition to be maximally compatible with Google dataset search, as metadata will need to be attached to this webpage.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, we could not do that, but exclusively rely on metadata queries for subdatasets. The latter sounds attractive, but while easy to use/do implies more complex operations under the hood.", "closed_by": {"login": "mih", "id": 136479, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjQ3OQ==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/136479?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih", "html_url": "https://github.com/mih", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/3095/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/3095/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
