I wonder if we could improve upon that.\r\n\r\nIn many cases the intention/result of the command is clear. e.g. if I `create .../subds`, I think it would be better to commit \"Added subdataset subds\" and \"Recorded changes caused by \"Added subdataset subds'\".  If there is multiple objects of action, they could be quantified (`X files, Y datasets`, etc).  And I think it should be possible if we collect a list of actions which were taken by the command before `*save` was invoked.\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>I do something like that in the (good, khe khe) and (definetely) old crawler:</summary>\r\n\r\n```\r\n    [DATALAD] Added files from extracted archives\r\n    \r\n    Files processed: 6202\r\n     skipped: 4\r\n     +annex: 6168\r\n    Branches merged: incoming->incoming-processed\r\n\r\ncommit c6259378478bbcc634b3295b0c710886b9eecb01 (origin/incoming, synced/incoming, incoming)\r\nAuthor: Yaroslav Halchenko <debian@onerussian.com>\r\nDate:   Tue May 16 23:20:05 2017 -0400\r\n\r\n    [DATALAD] Updated git/annex from a remote location\r\n    \r\n    URLs processed: 34\r\n    Files processed: 35\r\n     skipped: 34\r\n     +git: 1\r\n```\r\n</details>\r\n\r\nRelated: \r\n- https://github.com/datalad/datalad-revolution/pull/71 - for non-automated/user input messages", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/3236/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/3236/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
