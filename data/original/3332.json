I'm fine leaving this until those land and then dealing with the conflicts.\r\n\r\n  * I've avoided OBSCURE_FILENAME for compatibility with older Windows, but I'm not sure that is something worth doing.  I'm happy to rewrite the tests using OBSCURE_FILENAME.\r\n\r\n  * This PR carries a change dealing with the runner.
