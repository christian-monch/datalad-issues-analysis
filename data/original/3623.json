DEB package, that pulls in `python3-datalad`.\r\n\r\nThe above procedure call will execute `python <proc> <ds>`. But on Debian without venvs this is Python 2. So it will either crash (no `python-datalad` installed), or (as in the case @adswa discovered) execute code within a PY2 DataLad installation, provided by an older `python-datalad` version.\r\n\r\nNot yet clear to me how to approach this best. Procedures are supposed to be any executable, so too much Python-specific fiddling would not be appropriate. OTOH we are the ones that issue the command call. Maybe we should stop guessing the interpreter and go proper UNIX shebang, and just rely on the executable being an actual executable.\r\n\r\nIf we do that, we likely have to introduce win-specific handling to keep things running over there.", "closed_by": {"login": "kyleam", "id": 1297788, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTc3ODg=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1297788?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam", "html_url": "https://github.com/kyleam", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/3623/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/3623/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
