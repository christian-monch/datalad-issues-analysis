Suppose somebody publishes a dataset with personal health information (PHI), and this dataset, along with all others, is mirrored on some computational platform.\r\n\r\nWhen an annexed file containing PHI is detected, the data platform can permanently delete the file contents and publish a new version with cleaned contents. Now suppose that some user had previously fetched the data on the computational platform, so PHI is now out in the wild, and may be accessible. The data may expire through some policy and eventually be dropped, but if the admins were made aware, they would presumably prefer to drop it immediately.\r\n\r\nAre there any features in git-annex/datalad that would allow us to more noisily mark files as \"purged, please drop\", such as a revocation list, and a way to configure a repository so that I automatically execute the drops?\r\n\r\nJust to get it out of the way, uncooperative clients and an active harvester of PHI aren't really in the threat model.
