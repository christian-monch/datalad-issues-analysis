question:  to provide access to S3 buckets not exposed publicly (thus requiring authentication via IAM credentials, such as HCP) and through the prefix/revisionids, instead of just to a pure keystore (as in native git-annex S3 special remote), we would need to provide an external special remote which would need again to implement S3 client capabilities for basic authentication/fetching.  It can be done but we will grow dependencies implementing the same functionality as what git-annex already has inside.\nSo a wild thought came:  may be git-annex could somehow expose S3 functionality to e.g. external special remotes through some API? ;)  could well be made into something even more generic.  git-annex has already capabilities for talking to a plethora of data hosting providers and thus may be could serve as a glorified \"ultimate downloader\"? or to say may be to expose itself  as yet another special remote capable of TRANSFER?\n", "closed_by": {"login": "yarikoptic", "id": 39889, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjM5ODg5", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39889?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic", "html_url": "https://github.com/yarikoptic", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/31/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/31/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
