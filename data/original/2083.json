it.\r\n\r\nAll this does (besides few fixes) is do a basic installation on windows and run `wtf` to see if anything works.\r\n\r\nFuture changes should slowly introduce stuff that out to work to the\r\n    tests\r\n\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nand now the stuff from January....\r\n\r\n\r\n#### What is the problem?\r\nWith all the annotations of tests which fail in direct and v6 modes, may be it is feasible now to approach having testing done on windows as well, and I think appveyor would be a good free service for that purpose ;)  It could help to catch issues \"spawning\" from windows origins, such as the one reported in https://github.com/datalad/datalad/pull/2066 ", "closed_by": {"login": "mih", "id": 136479, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjQ3OQ==", "avatar_url":
