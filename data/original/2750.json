If using something like the a LORIS providers to crawl other server users need to know to copy the config file from datalad's source to the right directory for the dataset and then tweek the urls (datalad only knows demo.loris.ca in the default install.)\r\n\r\nIt would be useful to have a well documented datalad subcommand which easily sets up authentication schemes in a dataset (ie. manages the `.dataset/providers` directory) from the command line rather having to know that they need to copy a file from a subdirectory of a subdirectory of the datalad repo and tweak the URLs.\r\n\r\n#### What steps will reproduce the problem?\r\n\r\nSit with someone who knows nothing about datalad and help them set up a crawler for their dataset which isn't included in the base datalad install.\r\n\r\n#### What version of DataLad are you using (run `datalad --version`)? On what operating system (consider running `datalad wtf`)?\r\n\r\n0.10.2\r\n\r\n#### Is there anything else that would be useful to know in this context?\r\n\r\nNot really a bug, just a suggestion. (There may be some config command that I'm overlooking which already does this.)\r\n\r\n#### Have you had any success using DataLad before? (to assess your expertise/prior luck.  We would welcome your testimonial additions to https://github.com/datalad/datalad/wiki/Testimonials as well)\r\n\r\nSome.", "closed_by": {"login": "yarikoptic", "id": 39889, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjM5ODg5", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39889?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic", "html_url": "https://github.com/yarikoptic", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/2750/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/2750/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
