However, we recently switched to testing with a\r\ngit-annex from conda by default, so the latest cron job failed in the\r\nsetup phase because a bundled git wasn't present [0].\r\n\r\nOne option would be to update the script to not expect a bundled git\r\nto exist.  However, instead let's just update the cron job to use the\r\nmaster branch from git.git.  This allows us to catch issues sooner\r\nthan waiting for a release.  The downside is that we may run into\r\nissues that won't actually make it into a Git release.  But (1) Git's\r\nmaster branch is usually quite stable indicator of what makes will it\r\ninto a release because topic branches first have to graduate from next\r\nand (2) I volunteer for the task of distinguishing \"in release or in\r\nmaster-only\" failures.\r\n\r\nSince we're doing a full rewrite of the script anyway, rename it to be\r\nmore consistent with the Travis option.  Also, note that, although\r\nthis script is short and simple, it is similar enough to\r\ntools/ci/install-minimum-git.sh in the master branch that it might be\r\nworth merging the two.\r\n\r\n[0] https://travis-ci.org/github/datalad/datalad/jobs/709288940\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n- [x] Drop temporary tip commit.\r\n      [passing build](https://travis-ci.org/github/datalad/datalad/builds/710005512)\r\n", "closed_by": {"login": "yarikoptic", "id": 39889, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjM5ODg5", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39889?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic", "html_url": "https://github.com/yarikoptic", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/4746/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/4746/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
