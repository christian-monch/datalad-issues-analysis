PR aims to show how it is intended. No comments on details yet, please. About concept and basic design decisions, comments are nevertheless welcome, of course.\n\nNotes:\n- interesting files here are mainly collection.py, collectionrepo.py, handle.py, handlerepo.py; Additions to AnnexRepo and GitRepo are less important for now.\n- test cases are outdated. Will change this point as soon as they are able to show how it works.\n- collection_demo.py; Aims to demonstrate how these classes are supposed to be used within datalad commands.\n- Example repos: https://github.com/bpoldrack/ExampleHandleJSON, https://github.com/bpoldrack/ExampleHandleRDF, https://github.com/bpoldrack/ExampleCollection.git\n- right after deciding to make the PR I noticed there are still some outdated comments in there. So, don't let yourself confuse by them. Pay more attention to the docstrings at the moment.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "yarikoptic", "id": 39889, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjM5ODg5", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39889?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic", "html_url": "https://github.com/yarikoptic", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/157/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/157/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
