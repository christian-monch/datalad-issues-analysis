But, if we explicitly say `get .` it's somewhat strange for the results to follow a different pattern, in that the explicitly passed dataset is not reported on at all. Plus: Not sure yet, how excluding the top-level dataset would work in the recursive case.\r\nAdditional aspect: While \"top-level\" is quite clear in case of (interactive) CLI usage, what would make sense becomes quickly vague in the context of the python API.\r\nFinally, from within `install` perspective might change again. It makes a lot of sense to return the (top-level) dataset, including \"notneeded\".\r\nSo, do I correct the tests to not expect no result for the top-level dataset or do I try to differentiate more special cases on what to yield under what circumstances?
