Adding is mostly done through `create-sibling` commands, but reconfiguration will more frequently be done via this command. More issue aspects:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Git considers a remote to exist as soon as there is a single `remote.<name>.something` variable. We OTOH can do very little without at least a url.\r\n- [ ] In addition to the above, `add_sibling` requires `--force` to configure anything once a remote is already known. It would make sense IMHO to be able to reconfigure some aspects and still be able to have it test that the major setting -- the url -- stays unmodified.\r\n- [ ] GitPython will fail to fetch from a remote unless there is a `remote.<name>.fetch` config variable. At present we do not check that configuring a sibling always results in such a var to be set.\r\n\r\n", "closed_by": {"login": "mih", "id": 136479, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjQ3OQ==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/136479?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih", "html_url": "https://github.com/mih", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/1235/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/1235/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
