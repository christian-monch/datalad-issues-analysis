Am I missing something?\r\n\r\n#### What steps will reproduce the problem?\r\n(disk space usage below is from the following DataLad dataset: https://github.com/conpdatasets/openpain-placebo_1.git) \r\n```\r\n$ datalad install <dataset of your choice>\r\n$ cd <dataset>\r\n$ du -chs  # to get the size of the directory before running `datalad get`\r\n25M\t.\r\n25M\ttotal\r\n\r\n$ datalad get *\r\n$ du -chs  # to get the size of the directory after having downloaded all files of the dataset\r\n626G\t.\r\n626G\ttotal\r\n\r\n$ datalad drop *\r\n$ du -chs  # to get the size of the directory after having dropped all the files\r\n510G\t.\r\n510G\ttotal\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### What version of DataLad are you using (run `datalad --version`)? On what operating system (consider running `datalad wtf`)?\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ datalad --version\r\ndatalad 0.15.1\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Is there anything else that would be useful to know in this context?\r\n\r\nNot that I can think of\r\n\r\n#### Have you had any success using DataLad before? (to assess your expertise/prior luck.  We would welcome your testimonial additions to https://github.com/datalad/datalad/wiki/Testimonials as well)\r\n\r\nI've been using it for a while now ;). Never checked the disk space after `datalad drop` before. Ran into disk space issues after downloading all CONP datasets to create zip files and noticed that `datalad drop` did not appear to free up much disk space once datasets have been fully downloaded...", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/6009/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/6009/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
