And it might not be worth it... \r\n\r\nI just ran into the use case, where \"token based\" reporting (with similar fingerprinting to #3649) could be useful - to automagically collect CI test errors (sample: https://github.com/datalad/datalad/issues/3647) (primary interest CI of main branches, not PRs)\r\n- reports would point to build logs\r\n- smart helper could have somehow figure out previous similar run for the branch which succeeded, and provide diff on code and WTF thus potentially identifying changes which lead to the crash \r\n- It would allow for earl(ier) detection of new issues or regressions (e.g. we have no clue when #3647 really came about and since it is a fluke, hard to tell)\r\n- In our case it is still `nose` though so not sure how (in terms of longevity etc) it would be worthwhile to develop a plugin to collect those failures automagically (with back references to the specific jobs).
