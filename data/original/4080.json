actually replace GitPython in `clone()`\r\n- [x] implement a leaner runner that is capable of pulling out progress info from a `git clone` run\r\n- [x] implement a progress info extractor for `git-clone` based on GitPython's approach, but simplified\r\n- [x] bring back progress reporting for `GitRepo.clone()\r\n- [x] document `WitlessRunner`\r\n- [x] find answer to test WTF\r\n- [x] show that this is sufficient for fetch/pull/push #4087 (concrete usage needs more work, but no structural limitation were identified, which was the aim within the context of this PR)\r\n- [x] basic tests\r\n- [x] decide whether to capture or kill all process output, instead of relaying it to the parent by default -- decided: better to relay then to hide by default.\r\n- [x] works just as well on
