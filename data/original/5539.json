I went light on the reported details, but, if desired, I think it should be straightforward to extend this approach later with more information.\r\n\r\nI decided to go with the name `--dry-run` because I think that's the most familiar/obvious name, though `--report` would align with `rerun`.  Also, `--report` might be a bit more natural if this option is later extended to take an optional value (e.g., to restrict or extend what is reported).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ touch foo\r\n$ datalad save\r\n\r\n$ datalad run --dry-run -i 'fo*' -o out 'cat {inputs[0]} >{outputs[0]}'\r\nDry run information\r\n location: /tmp/dl-vaZ53PN\r\n expanded inputs:\r\n  ['foo']\r\n expanded outputs:\r\n  ['out']\r\n command:\r\n  cat {inputs[0]} >{outputs[0]}\r\n expanded command:\r\n  cat foo >out\r\n```\r\n", "closed_by": {"login": "mih", "id": 136479, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjQ3OQ==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/136479?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih", "html_url": "https://github.com/mih", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/5539/reactions", "total_count": 2, "+1": 2, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/5539/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
