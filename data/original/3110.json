ATM this is not needed, we only have one, but we better have the design reflect this future need. OTOH I don't see ourselves creating aggregates in more flavors than whatever we consider best at any given time.\r\n- RF to reduce code duplication\r\n- (to be continued)", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/3110/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/3110/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
