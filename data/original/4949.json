Well -- we cannot\r\nactually try all possible combinations of tricky filename components, but we can\r\nassume that we could test adding each tricky part individually to arrive at the\r\ntrickiest one.  That is what this PR does -- replaces static list with generation\r\nfrom parts.\r\n\r\nAlso it adds commented out \"%b5\" identified to trigger issues with datalad-archive\r\nspecial remote (#4950).  It is the motivation for this RF -- it was virtually impossible to figure out where in the chain of hardcoded candidates I should stick it in. With this commit/PR I just want to RF to see if no side-effect and then\r\nwe can see what else breaks if \"urlencode\" like component is added to the filename.\r\n\r\nAnd then I will build another PR on top to fix (if possible ;)) that other issue while adding that additional more obscure filename part.\r\n\r\nIn the PR I tried to retain compatibility (thus there is still OBSCURE_FILENAMES list) so no extensions would break etc.", "closed_by": {"login": "yarikoptic", "id": 39889, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjM5ODg5", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39889?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic", "html_url": "https://github.com/yarikoptic", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/4949/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/4949/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
