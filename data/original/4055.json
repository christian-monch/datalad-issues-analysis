We use lexical operations and comparisons on paths in many places, and we always assume full/long paths. Hence this is a big deal on windows. In particular the GitHub CI machines are set up in a way that make them appear frequently.\r\n\r\nAs seen here https://github.com/datalad/datalad/pull/4054#issuecomment-576150443 switching from `op.realpath` to `Path.resolve()` takes care of this issue in a convenient fashion. Therefore I propose to replace any use of `op.realpath` with the pathlib equivalent. This will not make any such issue go away, but it should substantially reduce our attack surface.\r\n\r\nThere is a complication: `resolve(strict=False)` was only introduced with PY3.6, before that it required a path to exist in order to be able to call this method.", "closed_by": {"login": "mih", "id": 136479, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjQ3OQ==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/136479?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih", "html_url": "https://github.com/mih", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/4055/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/4055/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
