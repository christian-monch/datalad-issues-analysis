With the merge of gh-4087, `fetch` now has a generator function analog (`fetch_`).  The `kwargs` of `fetch` are deprecated in favor `git_options` and are not available in `fetch_`.\r\n\r\nSo, at the very least, I think the use of `kwargs` should be changed.  But I think there are two other things worth considering:\r\n\r\n* The first `fetch` call should catch a `CommandError` and turn that into an appropriate result record so that `--on-failure=continue|ignore` are honored.\r\n\r\n* The `FetchInfo` objects returned by `fetch_` could be translated to result records that are reported to `update` callers.  But perhaps that'd be too noisy for the `fetch --all` case.\r\n ", "closed_by": {"login": "kyleam", "id": 1297788, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTc3ODg=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1297788?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam", "html_url": "https://github.com/kyleam", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/4154/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/4154/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
