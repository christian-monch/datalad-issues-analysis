With\r\nthis system, some options aren't accessible.  Taking the example from\r\ngh-5503: `datalad.procedure.NAME.call-format` cannot be set with\r\n`DATALAD_PROCEDURE_NAME_CALL__FORMAT` when `NAME` (based on the\r\nprocedure file name) includes an underscore or an upper case\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nLift this restriction by adding support for a DATALAD_CONFIG_OVERRIDES\r\nenvironment variable whose value is a JSON record with configuration\r\nvalues.  These values have a precedence just below values set directly\r\nvia DATALAD_ environment variables.\r\n\r\nFixes gh-5503.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\ncc @bpoldrack\r\n\r\nFrom the datalad standpoint, this is perhaps more of a feature than a fix, but I've decided to place this against maint so that the associated [datalad-hirni issue][1] can be resolved sooner.  Given that there's no change of behavior if `DATALAD_CONFIG_OVERRIDES` isn't set, it's unlikely to be problematic.  The one thing I can think of is if some third-party library has some custom handling of a `datalad.config.overrides` option and is relying it being accessible through the `DATALAD_CONFIG_OVERRIDES` environment variable, which seems very unlikely.\r\n\r\n[1]: https://github.com/psychoinformatics-de/datalad-hirni/issues/177\r\n", "closed_by": {"login": "bpoldrack", "id": 10498301, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDk4MzAx", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10498301?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bpoldrack", "html_url": "https://github.com/bpoldrack", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bpoldrack/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bpoldrack/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bpoldrack/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bpoldrack/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bpoldrack/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bpoldrack/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bpoldrack/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bpoldrack/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bpoldrack/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/5505/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/5505/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
