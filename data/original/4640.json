I might look into making it possible to install specific version from conda-forge -- want first to see if the whole machinery would work. \r\n\r\nAlso with that script it should be possible to quickly deploy desired flavor (I guess I should have used that word instead of \"scenario\") of git-annex build.  Eventually might also figure out how to automate fetching the snapshot build from the most recent one in datalad-extensions.\r\n\r\nTODOs @yarikoptic sees before merging\r\n- [X] verify that actually setting TMPDIR was in effect (e.g. pidlock was engaged in nfs based test case)\r\n   Update: Checked as done based on (perhaps unsound) reasoning at https://github.com/datalad/datalad/pull/4640#issuecomment-658245569\r\n- [x] move tune up of ~/.bashrc inside that helper (as cmdline option).
