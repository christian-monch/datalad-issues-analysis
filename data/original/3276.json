But I bet we already discussed it at least in the context of `create-sibling` vs `siblings create`.  So ATM we have\r\n- `subdatasets`\r\n\r\nBUT for other entities we do not have similar \"gate\" command with sub-actions, while by default just listing the known entities of the kind.  E.g. we have following commands which list different entities\r\n- `containters-list` (from `datalad-container` extension)\r\n- `run-procedure --discover` - to list procedures\r\n- `search --show-keys` - a bit of a stretch here, and if any RF might just need to migrate somehow into `metadata` command probably?\r\n\r\nSo I wonder if we should look into unifying interface across those, so whenever there is a clear entity which commands operate \"on\" (`containers`, `procedures`) - there should be a gateway command which would by default just list the known ones (like `siblings` and `subdatasets` do now)\r\n", "closed_by": {"login": "mih", "id": 136479, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjQ3OQ==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/136479?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih", "html_url": "https://github.com/mih", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/3276/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/3276/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
