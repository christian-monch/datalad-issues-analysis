See here for a demo https://ci.appveyor.com/project/mih/datalad-revolution/builds/20644761\r\n    there is an explicit `assure_bytes()` call in the code that is the culprit here. Not sure what the reason is/was.\r\n- [ ] test_run_failure uses sh cmd:  `echo x$(cat grows) > grows && false`  it looks as if a simple failing command would do too, but for some reason the aspect of repeated invocation is tested(?)
