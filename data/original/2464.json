As an example, if '*' was used to indicate all annex files, a rerun would consider the inputs to be all of the annex files at the time of the initial run.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Expansion during the initial run seems appropriate because most of the time re-executing a command should only require those inputs.  However, it's possible that the caller would want to rerun a command that uses globs itself to get its input files, in which case files that were added after the initial run wouldn't be retrieved.\r\n\r\n    Perhaps we could also store the unexpanded inputs and add a rerun flag that says to use the unexpanded set.\r\n\r\n    Update: I'm still not sure, but the current approach is to store unexpanded unless the `--expand` option is used.\r\n\r\nNote: #2432 mentioned --input=. as meaning all annex files should be present, but I didn't end up adding that because it's possible with globbing (`--input='*'`).\r\n\r\nre: #2158, #2432\r\n", "closed_by": {"login": "mih", "id": 136479, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjQ3OQ==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/136479?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih", "html_url": "https://github.com/mih", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/2464/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/2464/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
