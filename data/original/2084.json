What I need/want is not a mode of operation which would be \"autodetect\" which we had before, but rather a helper to figure out which of the metadata parsers I could and possibly should enable for any particular dataset.  Ideally, if I could run `datalad aggregate-metadata --guess-parsers-only` which would \r\n\r\n- report per parser a number of entities (files?) which it detected within dataset to bear some metadata it could parse\r\n- augment `.datalad/config` with those detected parsers it detected to be useful for this particular dataset.  \r\n\r\nThen I could inspect above output and `git diff`, agree/change and save.  I could also, in the future as more parsers get introduced, to rerun the command and see if any new parsers found to be possibly useful for this dataset.\r\n\r\nThis would also address a usability issue that parsers are not really exposed well to the user, so it is impossible to know (at a level or user API)  which parsers are available and which ones are applicable to this particular dataset.\r\n", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/2084/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/2084/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
