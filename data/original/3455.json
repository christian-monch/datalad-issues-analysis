This could be a model that could be applied to other `create_sibling*` commands too. If we do that, we finally have a straightforward path to replacing `create_sibling()` with an actual wrapper command that can call the appropriate actual implementation for a given target (thx to @bpoldrack for pointing this out). We could then (finally) revert the rename of `create_sibling_sshwebserver`. The common API would then be:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncreate-sibling-... -d <dswithconfig> -s NAME -r -R <int> --publish-depend <label> [PATH [PATH ...]]\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhere `PATH` is a directory with (a) specific dataset(s) to create a sibling for. Any other option not listed above is considered implementation specific, and a command must come with the ability to read its value from a configuration, if not given.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/3455/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/3455/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
