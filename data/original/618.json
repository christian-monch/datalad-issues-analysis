It is simple, it is based on standards, it doesn't care much about the format the meta data is stored in.\n\nhttp://guides.scholarsportal.info/c.php?g=126730&p=829289 (search for \"example 1\")\n\nHere are the more comprehensive specs from dryad: http://wiki.datadryad.org/images/8/8b/Dryad3.0.pdf\n\nFor us the \"Dryad\u2029Data\u2029Package\u2029Module\" is most relevant, but likely we only need to actively use a subset of that.\n\nExample of such meta data use from datacite: http://data.datacite.org/10.5061/DRYAD.1642B (see \"other formats\" especially).\n\nEssentially, we only need a mapping from a bunch of terms to some values. Order is irrelevant, additional content is irrelevant (but possible). Storage format is largely arbitrary, as long as we do not invent one (could be CSV, YAML, turtle, anything that allows for a mapping).\n\nRegarding subdataset aggregation: We should stick to what we agreed on a while back -- copy individual files upward into a shadow directory tree, with an optional limit on recursion level. This would be solely for the purpose of obtaining meta data for uninstalled subdatasets. This will keep simple datasets simple, and complex dataset somewhat simple still. Meta data users (including us) can employ this resource and make sense of it through the use of standard terms. Optimized meta data representations for queries (if any) should be compiled on any client machine, but not affect the representation inside a dataset repository.\n\nThoughts? @yarikoptic @bpoldrack \n", "closed_by": {"login": "mih", "id": 136479, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjQ3OQ==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/136479?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih", "html_url": "https://github.com/mih", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/618/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/618/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
