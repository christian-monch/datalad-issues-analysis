It would be very useful to have conceptually congruent implementations that embody a kind of \"best of breed\" approach to solve a given task with a given version of the API. This would allow for adding a dedicated benchmark CI run to compare task performance between (major) release, rather than command performance (which is impossible whenever commands change semantics, or vanish ala `add()`). This would also capture high-level improvements by utilizing more flexible or more capable features and/or new command to solve a given task.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/3744/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/3744/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
