This index is a set of key-value pairs, where the keys are dotted-name representations of the objects that the extractors return, for example: \"datalad_core.id\".\r\n\r\nThe conversion from metadata-object hierarchies to key-value pairs is done automatically. The automated conversion is necessarily generic and works well for a number of metadata objects, but will not always produce the desired results. For example, JSON-LD-like metadata objects are usually represented in unnecessary detail.\r\n\r\nI suggest creating a registry for metadata-to-index conversion where metadata extractors can register a conversion method that will create the \"desired\" key-value pairs from their output. This conversion method could then be used for metadata objects emitted by the registered extractors. Indices for all other metadata objects would still be created by the automated object-index conversion.\r\n", "closed_by": {"login": "christian-monch", "id": 17925232, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE3OTI1MjMy", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17925232?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/christian-monch", "html_url": "https://github.com/christian-monch", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/christian-monch/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/christian-monch/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/christian-monch/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/christian-monch/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/christian-monch/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/christian-monch/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/christian-monch/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/christian-monch/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/christian-monch/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/4944/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/4944/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
