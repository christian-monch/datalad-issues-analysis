It actually reflects upon our implicitly understood semantic in verbal communications.  When we say \"in core datalad\" we refer to this particular main `datalad` repository, codebase.  And that is what `coreapi` is about.  And when we say \"in datalad core\" we do typically imply `datalad.core` ;)\r\n\r\nI think one of those \"core\"s needs to go or get \"renamed\" for 1.0.  I am not sure if there is any value in \"coreapi\" ATM, so we could just dissolve it.  And also I would offer to call this main datalad project a \"base\", so we could say 'in base datalad' or 'in datalad base' (and never get `datalad.base`!)", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/4590/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/4590/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
