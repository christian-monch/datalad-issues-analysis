in #17, I wanted to also bring one about non-direct (i.e. regular/classical) annex'es and their impact.  As http://git-annex.branchable.com/internals/ and http://git-annex.branchable.com/internals/lockdown/ outlines, to prevent accidental removal of the file, every file is placed under `.git/annex/objects/aa/bb/KEY/KEY` directory. where for KEY directory 'w' permission is taken away so the KEY file can't be removed.  It indeed solves the accidental removal issue, but\n1. it nearly doubles inodes needed for the repository.  So on large ones, impact on the file system might be notable (on smaug I have 100mil inodes in use now :-/ could have been just 50mil? ;))\n2. operations (even a simple du or ls -R) might take MUCH longer since leaf directories are to contain a single file and thus there is quite a heavy file hierarchy traversal is needed.\n\nThere was a recent comment http://git-annex.branchable.com/internals/lockdown/#comment-f77526824d026f213ea98939fda9ac4c possibly on linux specific way, but I wondered:  Why just not to take 'w' permission away from `.git/annex/objects/aa/bb` directories, and store files under.  Yes -- for any get/drop that directory permission would need to flip to being writable but with proper guards around, and fsck checking, (or just adding some lock file which if not removed would signal that one of the underlying directories might have been left writable) I bet it should be feasible to make it work quite reliably without sacrificing FS meta-information real estate/performance?\n", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/32/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/32/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
