The German message in the screenshot below (last line) says that the log file that it tries to remove is still \"in use\" by another process. I assume this other process is the downloader. If that is correct, we need to work on the timing of these actions.\r\n\r\nIf we can get this to work, we can consume our public datasets on windows -- major milestone if you ask me....\r\n\r\nAh, and to be clear: this happens during cleanup -- it did actually download the file successfully before.
