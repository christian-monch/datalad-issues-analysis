While this is an improvement it actually is the wrong place to honor that config in the first place, which should be honored by helpers in `datalad/tests/utils.py` instead, while actual datalad code that may use `get_tempfile_kwargs` should rely on `TMPDIR` but not on `DATALAD_TESTS_TEMP_DIR`. Furthermore, we only ever read this setting from env var although it's supposed to be a config that also can be read from config files (`ConfigManager`). Therefore, this PR\r\n\r\n - sets the default `datalad/utils.py:get_tempfile_kwargs` to `TMPDIR` and let the test helpers call it by getting the value for `datalad.tests.temp.dir` from `ConfigManager` and pass it via the `dir` argument.\r\n - fixes `has_symlink_capabilities` to respect `datalad.tests.temp.dir` and thereby test the location the tests are actually supposed to run in\r\n - results in fixing `get_most_obscure_supported_filename` for the same effect\r\n\r\nLooking through the tests there are several similar issues fixed in the process:\r\n\r\n - fixes several issues in the tests, where we only considered an env var, when we should read a config\r\n - make use of `patch_config` in several places, since patching environment to test the effect of configs wasn't always correct and can have side effects on other tests\r\n", "closed_by": {"login": "kyleam", "id": 1297788, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTc3ODg=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1297788?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam", "html_url": "https://github.com/kyleam", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/4733/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/4733/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
