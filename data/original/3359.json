I think this comes down to one `git-log` call per file in question.\r\n\r\nThe new extractor implementation coming via https://github.com/datalad/datalad-revolution/pull/84 also needs to be adjusted to report potentially annex run-record files as \"content needed\".\r\n\r\nIt seems sensible to split the provenance information into two components\r\n\r\n1.
