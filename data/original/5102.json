In current form of #5022 we parallelize only within traversal of each path, not across paths.  I have not looked into the code, but it might be just a matter of making \"producer\" a chain of multiple from multiple paths (if current code composition allows for that; if not -- might be yet another use case for \"nested parallelization\" aspect which is also not yet approached by #5022 ).", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/5102/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/5102/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
