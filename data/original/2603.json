But already does meaningful things now (but limited to clean datasets right now).\r\n\r\nDesired functionality is not limited to dataset management/setup use cases (for which datalad could ship a bunch of procedures), but also targets totally custom user-provided functionality. Example:\r\n\r\nA dataset can provided implementations of a bunch of algorithms. Another dataset can include this dataset as a subdataset and configure its own `datalad.locations.dataset-procedures` config to extend search for procedures to the subdataset directory. This can be used to expose a \"toolchain\" of arbitrary procedures to the new parent dataset. Such procedures can be full blow data processing pipelines...\r\n\r\nTODOs (not necessarily all in this PR):\r\n\r\n- [x] revive the `run-before`/`run_after` functionality that is commented out right now. This will reenable the configuration handling to run arbitrary procedures before and after other commands, based on user configuration.
