I was just about to file an issue about why `save` has no `--to-git` -- and of course `add` has...\r\n\r\nWhat about this:\r\n\r\n- `add` is about adding stuff to a dataset that is not already in its directory tree\r\n- `save` is about everything that is already there\r\n\r\nRational: we are doing auto-adds, auto-commits, etc. Keeping this add/commit commit distinction just for files in the working tree seems inconsistent.\r\n\r\n`save` already deals with untracked submodules that it happens to find. Being able to check files into git directly (non-annex) seems like the last missing piece.", "closed_by": {"login": "mih", "id": 136479, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjQ3OQ==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/136479?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih", "html_url": "https://github.com/mih", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/1106/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/1106/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
