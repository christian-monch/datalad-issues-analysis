Alternatively I could kick out that commit which does set default to `auto` for AnnexRepo interfaces, and keep the rest, but then I think it would loose the point of all other RFings... uff...  At least for `maint` we could take the BF and handling for `0` value (as to \"do not bother annex\") which is now the effect of setting it to `1` (prior default) but then there is no way to overload our or annex config setting (if set > 1) via env var as should be possible.\r\n\r\nPlease see individual commits  for more reasoning etc.\r\n\r\nIn any case, I am interested to see if\r\n- [x] we gain run time speed ups for CIs\r\n   - not spotted any gain\r\n- [x] anything fails\r\n   - quite enough -- see below/referenced to this PR\r\n- [ ] decide on how to proceed if at all (besides a tiny bugfix PR)\r\n\r\nedit 1: in `maint` we still have 7.20190503 min annex version, and in `master` 8.20200309.
