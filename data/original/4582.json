state of a tracked remote, on a if-there-is-any basis, otherwise like `--since=None`\r\n- `--since='something' -> diff against this commit\r\n\r\nI dislike `push --since ''`. What about changing that to a more expressive `push --since ^` to indicate \"previous/last\" state.\r\n\r\nI briefly considered making `^` AKA `''` the default, but that would require introducing a cmdline compatible symbol to indicate \"since ever\" or \"everything\".\r\n\r\n@datalad/developers Please let me know what you think.
