Other versions auto-upgrade to 8.\r\n\r\nDealing with the v6->v7 default change put us in a better place in terms of dealing with future repo version bumps, but I was bit too hopeful in thinking that perhaps we wouldn't need any changes to be compatible with v8.  Here are the failures I know about, but I'll update this list once I do a wider sweep of the tests.\r\n\r\n- [x] Account for the removal of `annex add --include-dotfiles`.  See 3cd375723 (annex.dotfiles, 2019-12-26).\r\n\r\n  This of course makes lots of tests fail, so there's no reason in listing specific ones.\r\n\r\n   update: gh-4214\r\n\r\n- [x] `test_publish_{simple,with_data}` due to addition of \"error-message\" key to `fsck(remote=None)` output\r\n\r\n  gh-4214\r\n\r\n- [x] `test_repo_version`\r\n\r\n  This test fails because it assumes that `git annex --version=N` will end up in a repo with a supported version, but that's not the case (e.g., 6 goes to 7, not 8 as the test/I expected).  I filed a [bug report][0] on git-annex's site.  Let's see what comes of that, but hopefully no update will be needed on our end.\r\n\r\n  update: Fixed by Joey upstream.\r\n\r\n  [0]: https://git-annex.branchable.com/bugs/__39__init_--version__61__N__39___can_land_on_unsupported_N+1\r\n", "closed_by": {"login": "kyleam", "id": 1297788, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTc3ODg=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1297788?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam", "html_url": "https://github.com/kyleam", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/4185/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/4185/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
