Everyone ... I am beginning to explore datalad and many concepts are new to me and had a simple question. Let's say I have super dataset and would like to have to combine two sub-datasets, one for code and one for data. The handbook suggests `datalad clone --dataset . \\` to clone a data dataset (I guess). Would I do the same for a repo that only consists of code? Should I use the regular git commands instead? (I'll crosspost this question in GitHub). Thanks!\r\n\r\n#### What steps will reproduce the problem?\r\n`datalad clone --dataset . \\`\r\n\r\n#### What version of DataLad are you using (run `datalad --version`)? On what operating system (consider running `datalad wtf`)?\r\n\r\n0.14.6, Windows 10\r\n\r\n#### Is there anything else that would be useful to know in this context?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n#### Have you had any success using DataLad before?\r\nJust starting.
