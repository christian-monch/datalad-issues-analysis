Ideally it should have done against master but since ATM our custom buildbot setup can't take in more than 100 commits I based it on some elderly state of enh-dataset branch\n\nNote that according to travis current last commit fails with some obscure failure \n\n```\nTypeError: __init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'constraintsszpfgjwpjg'\n```\n\nI would appreciate if you guys look into.
