This time, I am processing some fmriprep data which will be about 6Tb in size, split into subdatasets. Trying to pull these changes into the master location will take another 6Tb and will take very long. Is there a way for me to copy the newly created subdataset folder called `fmriprep` in the master location, and just register it as subdataset in the parent dataset? In Linux command line this would be just the `mv` command, which is much faster than copying 6Tb of data.\r\n\r\nA bonus question as well :) I am planning to create subdatasets for each subject, but data for each subject is split into multiple folders like this:\r\n\r\n**./fmriprep/sub-11111111 (folder)**\r\n./fmriprep/sub-22222222 (folder)\r\n**./fmriprep/sub-11111111.html (file)**\r\n./fmriprep/sub-22222222.html (file)\r\n**./freesurfer/sub-11111111 (folder)**\r\n./freesurfer/sub-22222222 (folder)\r\n\r\nIs there a way for subdatasets to track specific folders in different places, like the bold items above?\r\n\r\n\r\n#### What steps will reproduce the problem?\r\nNA, my problem only.\r\n\r\n#### What version of DataLad are you using (run `datalad --version`)? On what operating system (consider running `datalad wtf`)?\r\n0.12.0rc6\r\n\r\n#### Is there anything else that would be useful to know in this context?\r\nNA\r\n\r\n#### Have you had any success using DataLad before?
