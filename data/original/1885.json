Due to the specific timing of a processing pipeline I have access to this tarball locally, but it is not yet available from a final (remote) location yet -- but I can reliably predict its future ssh URL.\r\n\r\nMy goal is to produce a dataset with the content of the extracted tarball, but set it up in a way that datalad would be able to obtain and use the tarball in order to get the dataset content to some machine. The situation is pretty much identical to what the crawler does and yields, but I (probably) cannot use the crawler itself, because the tarball is not at its remote location yet -- moreover although there is access to the tarball locally at the time of processing, there might be insufficient authorization to access the remote location (think: automated processing in trusted environment vs. personal access to storage with sensitive data).\r\n\r\nHow would I go about this? Any pointers on what pieces are the best starting point? Any thoughts in RF direction of crawler code, if necessary at all?", "closed_by": {"login": "mih", "id": 136479, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjQ3OQ==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/136479?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih", "html_url": "https://github.com/mih", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/1885/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/1885/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
