The same is also taking place when using `datalad drop` on a folder with many identical files.\r\n#### What steps will reproduce the problem?\r\n1. Inside a dataset, create a folder. Inside that folder, create 2 copies of the same file with different names. Then create a subfolder and copy the previously created file in this subfolder with a different name.\r\n2. Use `datalad save` and `datalad publish` to send the data to any remote.\r\n3. Use `datalad drop` to drop the folder through the Python API. The result will only display one path for a dropped file as if only a single file was dropped although three files were dropped.\r\n3. Use `datalad get` on the first folder created in step one using the Python API. Looking at the result will only display one path for the file as they all share the same annexkey.\r\n#### What version of DataLad are you using?\r\nDatalad: datalad 0.10.1\r\nOS: Ubuntu 18.04.1 LTS\r\n#### Is there anything else that would be useful to know in this context?\r\nI am not sure if this is a limitation from git-annex or this this was a design choice. I understand that git-annex uses the files MD5 to generate the annex key so in reality, only one git-annex object is gotten and dropped each time. However, I believe it could be a nice addition for the user to have a list of paths when many files point to the same git-annex object.\r\n", "closed_by": {"login": "simon-dube", "id": 10710692, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzEwNjky", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10710692?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/simon-dube", "html_url": "https://github.com/simon-dube", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/simon-dube/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/simon-dube/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/simon-dube/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/simon-dube/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/simon-dube/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/simon-dube/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/simon-dube/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/simon-dube/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/simon-dube/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/2746/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/2746/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
