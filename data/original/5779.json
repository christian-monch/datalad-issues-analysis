Luckily git-annex seems to work on bare-git https://git-annex.branchable.com/bare_repositories/ .\r\nBut when I try to run `git annex get --branch main` while in the bare-git in the ria-store, I get the following error.\r\n```\r\n$ git annex get\r\ngit-annex: This repository is not initialized for use by git-annex, but ./annex/objects/ exists, which indicates this repository was used by git-annex before, and may have lost its annex.uuid and annex.version configs. Either set back missing configs, or run git-annex init to initialize with a new uuid.\r\n```\r\nIs there any difference between the ria/ora bare-git and a bare git such as used in the git-annex page above.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n#### What steps will reproduce the problem?\r\n\r\n`git-annex get` on a dataset exported to a ria-store.\r\n\r\n#### What version of DataLad are you using (run `datalad --version`)? On what operating system (consider running `datalad wtf`)?\r\n0.14.0\r\n\r\n#### Is there anything else that would be useful to know in this context?\r\n#### Have you had any success using DataLad before?
