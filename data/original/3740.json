Part of the problem is that we do not have falsifiable criteria for deciding when a release is due. We have a milestone for an upcoming major release, but we did not release when it had zero open issues. We discussed that API-breaking changes should be collected in order to make one big difficult release, but it turns out that stopping that train is hard.\r\n\r\nI want to propose a switch to time-based major releases.\r\n\r\nWith a growing developer base and more complex requirements regarding development directions we would benefit from simplifying the decision making process around releases. A fixed date also helps to inform development speed and merge/deployment targets (Can I make it in time for 0.xx? Is this a new -core feature for 0.xx+2, or rather a long-lived extension). Offering a reliable release schedule is also instrumental for the planning that needs to happen for the various deployments of datalad-based tooling.\r\n\r\nHow often? The changelog it seems to suggest that twice per year would be enough for major releases.\r\n\r\nWe could consider cutting a release branch (e.g.) one month prior to the release date. All devs and interested parties would then have some time for test drive it, and submit necessary fixes.\r\n\r\nThe act of releasing should only comprise a `git tag` and PyPi upload, and require no more further work than to compose an up-to-date changelog. Any further aspects should either happen pre or post release (e.g. if backportability to particular Ubuntu versions is considered a release criterion there should be a CI run for that, such that any issues are obvious to any dev causing them when they cause them).\r\n\r\nIf we decide to go forward with this proposal, let's release one month after the decision was made.", "closed_by": {"login": "yarikoptic", "id": 39889, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjM5ODg5", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39889?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic", "html_url": "https://github.com/yarikoptic", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/3740/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/3740/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
