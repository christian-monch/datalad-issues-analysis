too\r\n\r\nWith this change we could also request parts for the composite credential,\r\nsuch as loris token, where they have index like :1, which we would sanitize now.\r\n\r\nHere is how the one for loris test would look like: DATALAD_KEYRING_loris_demo_1__token\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n- [ ] add basic documentation about credentials (in the docs) and how they could be specified via env vars \r\n- [ ] add a test if we don't have any (if nothing breaks ATM)\r\n- [ ] check interaction with config and `wtf` to make sure we don't leak those", "closed_by": {"login": "mih", "id": 136479, "node_id":
