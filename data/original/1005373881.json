However, that one is a convoluted mess. The reason it's passing to begin with (in `master` that is) is a bit absurd. The POST request I ripped out, does fail with `Unsupported request` by the http server used in the test, leading to a different call path that ultimately makes the assertion pass. So, sending an unsupported POST is required to correctly fail with `AccessDeniedError`. W/O that POST request, there still is an `AccessDeniedError`, but it ends up being handled by trying to ask for credentials which then somehow fails with an `AssertionError` instead.\r\nI think that test is simply wrong.
