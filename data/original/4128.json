Looking at all the logic and comments in the code: https://github.com/datalad/datalad/blob/master/datalad/support/annexrepo.py#L2578\r\n\r\nand now that all bits for direct mode handling are gone, https://github.com/datalad/datalad/pull/4127 removes call to `--dry-run`, it seems that custom logic there is to provide \"consistent\" (according to our idea of consistency) behavior for git-annex while committing files which might jump between git/git-annex (depending on .gitattributes etc).  There were tons of changes in git-annex since then (which was in 2018), and our minimal \"supported\" git-annex version atm is 7.20190503 . So, I think it would be valuable to check if may be current git-annex already behaves \"consistent\" with our expectations in such cases, and thus completely deprecate `AnnexRepo.commit`", "closed_by": {"login": "mih", "id": 136479, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjQ3OQ==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/136479?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih", "html_url": "https://github.com/mih", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/4128/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/4128/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
