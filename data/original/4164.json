It's a special remote.) More of that will have to wait until we're done with more essential parts.\r\n\r\n\r\nEdit/Update:\r\n\r\nNew Plan. We need the special remote in master urgently on our side. As long as we don't break anything in core, a merge will only lead to make it easier to deal with RIA. Some of the things I still need to do require proper RF'ing first. So, strongly vote for merge - I'll open follow-up PRs instantly, that can be used for review etc. There need to be at least the following things to address in next PRs:\r\n\r\n- RF to move the creation of the remote end (may include a separation of store creation from dataset creation)\r\n- Find a spot for docs and update them (last step of moving into core - git-annex-ria-remote repo can be archived/deleted/ignored after that)\r\n- Rework tests. Partially outdated and otherwise not nicely structured ATM.\r\n- Move remote execution to the command abstraction classes\r\n", "closed_by": {"login": "mih", "id": 136479, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjQ3OQ==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/136479?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih", "html_url": "https://github.com/mih", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/4164/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/4164/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
