E.g. so far I have not heard much of questions and WTF statements about e.g. export-to-figshare which is highly interactive.  But users do come back inquiring about various warnings and errors we spit out when cmdline specification is \"not good enough\".\r\nSo in this PR I am trying to resolve a specific complaint/question about unclear error `publish` reports whenever multiple remotes/siblings could be used for publishing.\r\n\r\n- in the case where there is no tracking remote yet specified, I switched from considering remotes with `push` spec to remotes with a `url`.  Main rationale -- remotes established by `create-sibling` have no `push` refspec.\r\n\r\nIn the long run we should even consider **all** remotes, since publish could be intended to publish to special remotes (so there would be no tracking branch established etc).\r\n\r\n- I also listed candidate remotes in the warning message (in case of non-interactive interface)\r\n\r\n- ui import is delayed, since otherwise not used much in the publish. But I am ok to move it out\r\n\r\n\r\nTODOs:\r\n- [ ] targetted unittest\r\n- [ ] reincarnate test for inability to publish when multiple remotes present, may be test added above could do that", "closed_by": {"login": "yarikoptic", "id": 39889, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjM5ODg5", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39889?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic", "html_url": "https://github.com/yarikoptic", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/3756/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/3756/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
