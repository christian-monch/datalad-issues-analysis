Messages for commits within preproc should be \"automated\" ones I guess (thus possibly relates to #3236 (automated commit messages)) but I would not even mind if the last one (currently \"[DATALAD] new dataset\") would be the one I have provided.\r\n\r\nFor such multi-commit executions I even wonder if solution could/should be similar, or may be even the same in implementation, to #3265 (`run` to cover multiple commits).  The idea of the \"merge\" commit to depict the end of the single action  kinda make sense in such scenarios.  In `create` it is a bit tricky (start from an \"empty state commit\") but doable AFAIK.\r\n\r\nSimilarly  `install` which is in the case of installing a new subdatset (e.g. `install -d . URL`) would generate commit within super dataset.\r\n\r\nP.S. I though we had such an issue filed but couldn't find it.
