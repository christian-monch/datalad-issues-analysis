Initially such initialization as was introduced\r\nbecause our submodule listing was using \"git submodule\" directly and now we do\r\nparsing ourselves and probably because of that probably it all works even\r\nwithout proper \"git submodule update --init  newsubmodule\" to make it properly\r\nregistered within .git/config.\r\n\r\nThis test is primarily to demonstrate the effect and seek decision on either it should\r\nbe addressed or not.  The main problematic use case I see which might mandate\r\naction is discovery of the web ui not being populated properly, especially whenever\r\nremote host has somewhat datalad DataLad\r\n\r\nOnly when submitting this PR I realized that this test/changes sit straight on top of 0.11.4, so before all the changes to post-update hook, and it still fails!   so something is not really working out even without disabling the post-update hook and/or removing `git submodule update --init` from it.\r\n\r\nThe question is largely, should \"datalad\" care to establish proper/clean/properly initialized hierarchy of submodules on the remote?  I would say \"yes\".  But I am not sure what would be the cleanest way in terms of where in DataLad.", "closed_by": {"login": "mih", "id": 136479, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjQ3OQ==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/136479?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih", "html_url": "https://github.com/mih", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/3338/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/3338/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
