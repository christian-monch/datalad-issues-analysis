I have seen this in the past and don't remember how it goes away, but maybe someone has an idea. The path is definitely there, I can see the content with `ls`.\r\n\r\n#### What steps will reproduce the problem?\r\nCan't find a way to reproduce easily. I am on Centos 7, installed datalad via pip3.\r\n\r\n#### What version of DataLad are you using (run `datalad --version`)? On what operating system (consider running `datalad wtf`)?\r\n0.12.7 and 0.13.0rc2\r\n\r\n#### Is there anything else that would be useful to know in this context?\r\nMaybe restarting the server helps, but can't do that often.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Have you had any success using DataLad before? (to assess your expertise/prior luck.  We would welcome your testimonial additions to https://github.com/datalad/datalad/wiki/Testimonials as well)\r\nAll ok.", "closed_by": {"login": "dorianps", "id": 9083517, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjkwODM1MTc=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9083517?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/dorianps", "html_url": "https://github.com/dorianps", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dorianps/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dorianps/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dorianps/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dorianps/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dorianps/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dorianps/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dorianps/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dorianps/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dorianps/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/4647/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/4647/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
