The purpose of this new command is to concentrate all code for sibling registration and meta data manipulation of siblings into a single command (set/change name, description, wanted policies, ....). Moreover, I would propose to treat \"here\" as another sibling and have the very same command also manipulate a standalone dataset.\r\n\r\nIn essence, all this command does are actions bound to a single dataset, plus a for-each-style recursive iteration of a dataset tree. For the latter we need to support a templating mechanism to e.g. transform a base URL to match a particular subdataset (so nothing new or fancy).\r\n\r\nList of related, unaddressed issues and previous discussions -- not necessarily TODO items for this PR, but the changes here should make those simpler to implement:\r\n\r\n- rewrite description #1484 \r\n- sibling/dataset configuration via templates #1462 \r\n- wanted policy setup #925 (related #921)\r\n- registration via datalad RIs #1438 \r\n- annex-only sibling tracking/update #1363\r\n- figure out if we want to treat \"here\" as yet another sibling and have the very same command also manipulate a standalone dataset (e.g. for description, wanted, ....). If so, how to indicate this best? `--name` no name could be `here`, but the we would need something for \"give me all info about all remotes\".\r\n- check (maybe via coverage) which parts of the legacy `add_sibling` became obsolete and gut the code accordingly\r\n- insufficient documentation #1017 \r\n- scary low-level logs #1519 \r\n\r\nActual TODOs:\r\n\r\n- [x] generalize `add_sibling` to `siblings` command #1235 - [ ] \r\n- [x] `siblings` is new-style generator\r\n- [x] `siblings` can remove a sibling (`remote remove`) #1483\r\n- [x] all internal use of `add_sibling` is via `siblings`\r\n- [x] tests for `siblings remove`\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n", "closed_by": {"login": "mih", "id": 136479, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjQ3OQ==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/136479?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih", "html_url": "https://github.com/mih", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/1500/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/1500/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
