"body": "I found my way here via the software carpentry website. I don't know a better way to generically contact folks in the project, but feel free to be in touch via email (my github username @berkeley.edu).\n\nWe're working on a project to create a common baseline of packages at UC Berkeley called BCE (the Berkeley Common Environment). The tools you are building sound like exactly the direction we'd like to be going in for data management. So, \"integrate\" here is not a heavy demand, just making sure BCE supports the python packages, etc. that you're relying on.\n\nNote that while we build ubuntu VMs, we don't use dpkg/apt to manage most of our python dependencies (there needs to be a strong reason to do so). We use pip. No slight intended against neurodebian, etc. - but this way you can still easily install the BCE python dependencies on, e.g., OS X. [This](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/collaboratool/blob/v0.1.x/provisioning/packages/python-requirements.txt) is our current list of dependencies.\n\nAnywho, git annex is awesome as a backend, but it's still too cumbersome to recommend to computational scientists who aren't necessarily \"committed to the cause.\" I'd love to support your efforts to get more people using git and git annex in a sensible way for science!\n\nIt'd be great to get this integrated in BCE. Then folks could very easily learn how to use these tools using VirtualBox, or EC2, or Docker, or whatever else we end up supporting.\n\ncc @aculich\n", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/20/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/20/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
