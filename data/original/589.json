I think we can support following format `/[locality]/[remote]/[path]`\n- `[locality]` is to signal \n  - `~` -- that it is a local user-wide centralized installation which we need to work with (e.g. `~/.datalad` or some other...)\n  - empty value -- remote locations registered within a given dataset we are in.  I.e. without `locality`=`~` prefix, and empty `remote`, we are referring to our canonical remote location http://datasets.datalad.org.\n\nBy default we could also make `/~//` behave as `/~/origin/` where origin would point again to our canonical super-dataset as a remote (note that `/~//` by itself is not a clone of it, just gets populated with the datasets from it)\n- `[remote]` would point to a possibly registered as a git remote some other (super)dataset.\n\nSo `datalad install /~//openfmri/ds000001` would result in \"installation\" of ~/.datalad/openfmri/ds000001.  In turn `datalad install ///openfmri/ds000001` would install `ds000001` under a local directory.\n\nWe should then allow to register additional 'remotes' for any of those -- some local (super-)dataset or the centralized one (`/~/`), e.g. \n`datalad register-dataset /~/studyforrest http://psydata.ovgu.de/studyforrest/` and then be able to  `datalad install /~/studyforrest/phase1` or just `datalad install -r /~/studyforrest`.  Similarly it would work for non-~ local deployments: `datalad register-dataset studyforrest http://psydata.ovgu.de/studyforrest` while being inside a dataset (or respect `-d ds` otherwise).\n\nThen we could provide support of those in `datalad ls` so I could e.g. do  `datalad ls //` to list all known remote datasets registered in the local ds.  `datalad ls //studyforrest` to list sub-datasets within studyforrest remote dataset.  Similar for all those `/~/` just within the centralized.\n\nsmth like that... I think it should scale, and it doesn't conflict (as far as I see) with shell handling of `~`  so we should be safe to use all those examples I have given\n", "closed_by": {"login": "yarikoptic", "id": 39889, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjM5ODg5", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39889?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic", "html_url": "https://github.com/yarikoptic", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/589/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/589/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
