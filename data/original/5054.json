Without that,  output from `cfg_` procedures totally ruins UX in parallel execution (#5022).\r\nThe question is how decision should be made either it is interactive or not I guess - should be required to be explicit (`cat /dev/null | `), or some procedures could \"announce\" that they would not have any interaction needed, or higher level function (e.g. `addurls`) would do that, ...  \r\n\r\nOR alternative -- we make `WitlessRunner` without protocol which swallows output to be threadlocked (and force cleaning up of the pbars before and restoring after)...  That would cause some slowdown but probably could be tolerable", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/5054/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/5054/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
