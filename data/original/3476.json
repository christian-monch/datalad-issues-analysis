This is not usually an issue for datasets because\r\nthese get initial commits on creation, so we documented this as a\r\nknown issue rather than introducing additional checks that would come\r\nwith a performance penalty.\r\n\r\nThe core problem is a combination of 'git submodule add' accepting a\r\nsub-repository on an unborn branch and 'git ls-files' considering such\r\na sub-repository a directory rather than a repository.  Both issues\r\nare fixed in Git 2.22.0 [1].
