We now\r\n  abort with an informative error in this situation.  ([#3176][])\r\n\r\n- Committing failed in some cases because we didn't ensure that the\r\n  path passed to `git read-tree --index-output=...` resided on the\r\n  same filesystem as the repository.  ([#3181][])\r\n\r\n- Some pointless warnings during metadata aggregation have been\r\n  eliminated.  ([#3186][])\r\n\r\n- With Python 3 the LORIS token authenticator did not properly decode\r\n  a response ([#3205][]).\r\n\r\n- With Python 3 downloaders unnecessarily decoded the response when\r\n  getting the status, leading to an encoding error.  ([#3210][])\r\n\r\n- In some cases, our internal command Runner did not adjust the\r\n  environment's `PWD` to match the current working directory specified\r\n  with the `cwd` parameter.  ([#3215][])\r\n\r\n- The specification of the pyliblzma dependency was broken.  ([#3220][])\r\n\r\n- [search] displayed an uninformative blank log message in some\r\n  cases.  ([#3222][])\r\n\r\n- The logic for finding the location of the aggregate metadata DB\r\n  anchored the search path incorrectly, leading to a spurious warning.\r\n  ([#3241][])\r\n\r\n- Some progress bars were still displayed when stdout and stderr were\r\n  not attached to a tty.  ([#3281][])\r\n\r\n- Check for stdin/out/err to not be closed before checking for `.isatty`.\r\n  ([#3268][])\r\n\r\n### Enhancements and new features\r\n\r\n- Creating a new repository now aborts if any of the files in the\r\n  directory are tracked by a repository in a parent directory.\r\n  ([#3211][])\r\n\r\n- [run] learned to replace the `{tmpdir}` placeholder in commands with\r\n  a temporary directory.  ([#3223][])\r\n\r\n- [duecredit][] support has been added for citing DataLad itself as\r\n  well as datasets that an analysis uses.  ([#3184][])\r\n\r\n- The `eval_results` interface helper unintentionally modified one of\r\n  its arguments.  ([#3249][])\r\n\r\n- A few DataLad constants have been added, changed, or renamed ([#3250][]):\r\n  - `HANDLE_META_DIR` is now `DATALAD_DOTDIR`.  The old name should be\r\n     considered deprecated.\r\n  - `METADATA_DIR` now refers to `DATALAD_DOTDIR/metadata` rather than\r\n    `DATALAD_DOTDIR/meta` (which is still available as\r\n    `OLDMETADATA_DIR`).\r\n  - The new `DATASET_METADATA_FILE` refers to `METADATA_DIR/dataset.json`.\r\n  - The new `DATASET_CONFIG_FILE` refers to `DATALAD_DOTDIR/config`.\r\n  - `METADATA_FILENAME` has been renamed to `OLDMETADATA_FILENAME`.", "creator": {"login": "yarikoptic", "id": 39889, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjM5ODg5", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39889?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic", "html_url": "https://github.com/yarikoptic", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "open_issues": 0, "closed_issues": 21, "state": "closed", "created_at": "2019-02-20T15:08:07Z", "updated_at": "2019-04-15T15:39:51Z", "due_on": null, "closed_at": "2019-04-15T15:39:51Z"}, "comments": 2, "created_at": "2019-03-14T17:34:04Z", "updated_at": "2019-03-14T22:26:06Z", "closed_at": "2019-03-14T19:46:46Z", "author_association": "MEMBER", "active_lock_reason": null, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/pulls/3222", "html_url": "https://github.com/datalad/datalad/pull/3222", "diff_url": "https://github.com/datalad/datalad/pull/3222.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/datalad/datalad/pull/3222.patch"}, "body": "If get_nohits_msg() doesn't return a message, report a generic \"no\r\nhits\" so that the caller isn't left wondering what the blank message is\r\nabout.\r\n\r\nFixes #3195.", "closed_by": {"login": "yarikoptic", "id": 39889, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjM5ODg5", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39889?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic", "html_url": "https://github.com/yarikoptic", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/3222/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/3222/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
