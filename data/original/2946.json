This leads to the Repos being flyweights wrt to realpath and Dataset being flyweight wrt the unresolved path!\r\n\r\nThere's a sideeffect to be mentioned: Previously it was possible to read/write `.datalad/config` via `Dataset.config` even if there was no repository (yet) at all. This is not the case anymore and I think this makes sense. Ultimately the previous behavior suggests, that you can store config at \"dataset-level\" (Parameter `where='dataset') while there is no dataset. This is misleading and I don't see a reason for it. However, a `Dataset` instance without an underlying physical repository still provides access to user and system level config, of course.\r\n\r\nAlso:\r\nCloses #2942 \r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n- [x] reevaluate `Dataset.repo`\r\n- [x] reevaluate `Dataset.config`\r\n- [x] reevaluate `Dataset.id`\r\n- [x] This change is complete\r\n\r\nPlease have a look @datalad/developers\r\n", "closed_by": {"login": "bpoldrack", "id": 10498301, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDk4MzAx", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10498301?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bpoldrack", "html_url": "https://github.com/bpoldrack", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bpoldrack/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bpoldrack/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bpoldrack/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bpoldrack/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bpoldrack/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bpoldrack/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bpoldrack/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bpoldrack/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bpoldrack/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/2946/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/2946/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
