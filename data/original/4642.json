A collaborator works to change a couple of subdatasets, then I pull the changes on the parent dataset. To do this properly, I do `datalad update --merge --recursive`. The problem is that with `--recursive` datalad goes into every subdataset, fetches changes, and applies them, which takes a long time for just a couple of subdatasets that need to be updated. May I suggest the creation of a more intelligent recursive approach, where only new or changed subdatasets are updated. This could be something like `--recursive [all | modified]`.\r\n\r\nI don't think this can be done with the current version, but if it's possible, please give me some tips on how to.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### What steps will reproduce the problem?\r\nNA\r\n\r\n#### What version of DataLad are you using (run `datalad --version`)? On what operating system (consider running `datalad wtf`)?\r\n`datalad 0.12.6`\r\n\r\n#### Is there anything else that would be useful to know in this context?\r\nNA\r\n\r\n#### Have you had any success using DataLad before? (to assess your expertise/prior luck.
