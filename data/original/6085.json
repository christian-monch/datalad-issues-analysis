It is the primary reason for datalad's slowness (especially on big datasets). Basically what we need is a way to execute a command, and start yielding outputs as quickly as possible, *not* waiting for the command to finish. When we have that, we also have batched command -- without the need for a dedicated implementation, because we also want to start yielding as quickly as possible for non-batched commands.\r\n\r\nMy under-performing brain thinks:\r\n\r\n- if we want to start acting on outputs, while we are still in a `run()` method, we need multithreading (at least)\r\n- we need to receive process output in the thread, turn it into a desirable structure (maybe JSON decode), and hand it over to the main thread for acting on it while more process output is received\r\n- it seems https://docs.python.org/3/library/queue.html is the standard exchange paradigm for this stuff\r\n\r\nIt would be ideal, if we could wrap this entire construct into something that acts as an iterable, is parameterized with a runner instance, and exposes the signature of `Runner.run()`", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/6085/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/6085/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
