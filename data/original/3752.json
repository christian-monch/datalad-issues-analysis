This leads to generally duplicate reporting. For example:\r\n\r\n```\r\n% datalad save\r\n[ERROR  ]   that3: setFileMode: permission denied (Operation not permitted) [add(/tmp/perm/that3)] \r\nadd(error): that3 (file) [  that3: setFileMode: permission denied (Operation not permitted)]\r\n```\r\n\r\nI propose to demote all log messages triggered like this to a level less than `info`, hence remove them from the default user experience.\r\n\r\nRational: \"error/impossible\"-type events can be caused by non-faulty probing behavior and those should not clutter the terminal with scary inconsequential messages. Still logging any of such events at a lower level keeps them accessible for debugging. In addition, any faulty behavior that only leads to an \"error\" log message, without a corresponding \"error\" result is likely a bug (e.g. not leading to non-zero exit code, on-failure handling not controllable, etc.).\r\n\r\nIf that is not acceptable, an alternative solution to a cleaner UX is to no longer add a logger to the result records -- but that is clearly inferior for a developer perspective.", "closed_by": {"login": "mih", "id": 136479, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjQ3OQ==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/136479?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih", "html_url": "https://github.com/mih", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/3752/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/3752/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
