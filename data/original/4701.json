Ideally - availability information from reachable remotes updated, and time stamps for each key updated to current date and then `forget` -- should be sufficient to destroy sensitive dates from the stored info when they were added to a remote.\r\n\r\nFor the other branches, I wondered \r\n- if may be `git fast-export/fast-import` could be used while altering dates in the commits metadata... but since it would be changing commits checksums, not sure if that would work.\r\n- could we use `git filter-branch` and adjust date information there?\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/4701/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/4701/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
