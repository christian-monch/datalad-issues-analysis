Any later analysis of the \"graph\" would come to the same question -- should we take only the specified by user outputs, or factual ones, or the union? (may be user specified outputs were re-generated and just didn't differ from previous state).  \r\nIn `--explicit` mode only the user-specified outputs are saved, so it becomes an intersection of action + specified. In non`--explicit` mode I think it would be useful to forewarn (and ultimately allow to adjust/amend somehow) that specified `--output`s were not sufficient or were completely different.  For that to work re-globing of outputs should be done after run (thus relation to #3448)\r\n", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/3449/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/3449/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
