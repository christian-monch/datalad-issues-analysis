Implementation should be reasonably straightforward since it would be just a matter of adjusting `sys.argv` to replace the aliased command with the alias (split the same was as shell splits). \r\nSimilar to git we could go one step further and provide \"python formatting\" aliases (may be similarly starting with `!` to indicate that) which we would feed all the options and positional arguments given after the alias command.\r\n", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/2693/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/2693/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
