Read-only access for now.\r\n\r\nThis is meant in conjunction with PR #4561.\r\nAs discussed over there, trying to change this to use streaming for GET. Reason for this is, that we currently need to read an entire file (or worse - extract an entire file) before we build the response, which suggests to lead to an undesirable latency. However, while I got streaming to technically work, with my local apache setup I see a slowdown by factor 2 instead of a speed-up. Not yet clear to me, what this is about. I suspected that simply connecting the 7z-subprocess-stdout to sys.stdout might get us into trouble with buffering, but an alternative approach using Popen and introduce a buffer didn't improve anything so far (at least with buffer sizes from 60K - 10MB it didn't make any noteable difference).", "closed_by": {"login": "bpoldrack", "id": 10498301, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDk4MzAx", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10498301?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bpoldrack", "html_url": "https://github.com/bpoldrack", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bpoldrack/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bpoldrack/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bpoldrack/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bpoldrack/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bpoldrack/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bpoldrack/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bpoldrack/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bpoldrack/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bpoldrack/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/4572/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/4572/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
