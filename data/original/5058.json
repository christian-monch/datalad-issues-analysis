This\r\nappeared to have something to do with the old SSH version on Xenial,\r\nand a workaround was applied on git-annex's end [1].  test_annex_ssh()\r\nskips from 7.20191230 to 8.20200720.1 to avoid this stall.\r\n\r\nHowever, test_annex_ssh() also stalls in the cron job that tests\r\nagainst git-annex 7.20190708 [2].  The build succeeds if\r\ntest_annex_ssh() is skipped [3].  It looks like the stall started with\r\nthe switch to the Docker SSH target [4].\r\n\r\nI cannot trigger this locally on a Debian Buster system with the\r\nDocker SSH target, so perhaps there's an interaction with the Xenial\r\nenvironment.
