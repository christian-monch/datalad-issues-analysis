This means that upon command execution an additional command is executed remotely (which only works on POSIX SSH servers) that determines where git-annex is installed.\r\n\r\nIssue 1: This implies an unconditional runtime cost whether or not git-annex commands are to be executed on the remote.\r\n\r\nIssue 2: Once the the install dir is figured out, it is used to alter the remote PATH and make it searched first. This can be problematic (e.g. #5030).\r\n\r\nIssue 3: This PATH setup is for POSIX servers only.\r\n\r\nIssue 4: For non-multiplexed connections (which we will need to support for windows), two connection attempts are needed, unconditionally, to determine the install path.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/5039/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/5039/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
