So, as of now, it makes sense to move the `DATALAD_REPO_VERSION=6` runs to `=7`.\r\n\r\nAnd when neurodebian's git-annex (i.e. what we test with on Travis) is at least 7.20190912, v5 will also auto-upgrade to v7.  I think this becomes a little tricky because, if our minimum git-annex version doesn't auto-upgrade, we'll want to still have a run that tests v5 repos.  So we'd either need to add a run that gets an older git-annex from somewhere else or bump the minimum required version.\r\n\r\nOnce the minimum git-annex version is above 7.20190912, we should still make sure that we have AnnexRepo tests that cover the auto-upgrading (I think we already do), but I don't see any reason we need dedicated runs for different `DATALAD_REPO_VERSION` (which means we can drop two builds from the matrix).", "closed_by": {"login": "kyleam", "id": 1297788, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTc3ODg=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1297788?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam", "html_url": "https://github.com/kyleam", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/4000/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/4000/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
