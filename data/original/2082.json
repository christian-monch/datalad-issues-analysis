Citing here:\r\n\r\nSome time back I looked at the connection points of the metadata support with the rest of the code base, and there are _very_ few. We should really consider throwing it out of the core code base. There could be a separate project, Datalad core could keep its original search functionality, and any dataset provider can decide which one to use. Having an external consumer of Datalad core API should also have a beneficial effect on its general utility over time.\r\n\r\nHeck, this could be a set of plugins...and it would be a good reason to elevate the plugin interface to behave like full-scale commands.... I start to like this... Maybe this could be a general path for additions/changes of datalad components. Implement them as plugins, bring them to people, let people decide what works and which way and only eventually move proven pieces into the core code base.\r\n\r\nmarked as belonging to 0.10 release decision for now", "closed_by": {"login": "mih", "id": 136479, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjQ3OQ==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/136479?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih", "html_url": "https://github.com/mih", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/2082/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/2082/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
