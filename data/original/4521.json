That is what we already do in `AnnexRepo.copy_to` and `.get`. @mih mentioned that [re-stat of files would be needed](https://github.com/datalad/datalad/pull/4503#issuecomment-626121177), but I think it is not needed if  sizes were taken from keys using `AnnexRepo.get_size_from_key` was used as it is done in various places in AnnexRepo already.
