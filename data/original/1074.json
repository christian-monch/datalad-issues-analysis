And it is also more compact in the datasets ...\r\n- [x] Going to versioned meta data item IDs allows us to distinguish between instances of the same dataset\r\n- [x] config variable `datalad.metadata.parsers.enable` to replace `metadata.nativetypes`\r\n- [x] config variable `datalad.metadata.parsers.disable` for \"negative selection\"  of parser, i.e. \"all but these two\"\r\n- [x] annex information now from a separate parser that can be enabled/disabled\r\n- [x] robustify `search` to keep working on mixture of old and new meta data\r\n- [x] each meta data item now comes with a `describedby` property that identifies the responsible parser (with version) to enable flexible and reliable filtering later on\r\n- [x] simple draft of a parser for file-based meta data that can report file name, size, mimetype and encoding\r\n- [x] `search` can now search for datasets _and_ files (datasets by default)\r\n- [x] switch to version 0.2 as meta data standard to reflect the changes\r\n- [x] enhance BIDS meta data parser to produce file-based meta data as well\r\n- [x] enhance `aggregate_metadata` to honor disabled parser in superdatasets -- this way users can configure selective meta data _removal_ in superdatasets, independent of the presence of the entire subtree, or without having to modify any subdataset.\r\n- [x] any non-essential (e.g. file-based) meta data is separated into by-parser files that are (optionally, and by default) annexed.\r\n- [ ] make optional annexed meta data files compressed by default -- no point in diffs anyway, so can be optimized for download\r\n- [ ] RF `search` to make room for alternative search algorithms\r\n- [ ] Implement support for SPARQL queries in `search`\r\n- [ ] add bacon\r\n", "closed_by": {"login": "mih", "id": 136479, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjQ3OQ==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/136479?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih", "html_url": "https://github.com/mih", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/1074/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/1074/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
