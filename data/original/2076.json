The old branch name was too\r\nnarrow in scope, so that seemed to be a good indicator that it was\r\nworth opening a new PR for.\r\n\r\nSome of the main differences:\r\n\r\n  * The rerun functionality is now under its own command, `datalad\r\n    rerun` (Closes #2072).\r\n\r\n  * You can now specify the base for re-execution explicitly using\r\n    `--onto`.\r\n\r\n    Specifying a branch name for the re-execution and the base is no\r\n    longer coupled.  Now you can re-execute on top of HEAD with a new\r\n    branch name, or re-execute at another point but in a detached\r\n    state.\r\n\r\n  * The `--root` flag can be used to say \"execute all commands in\r\n    commits reachable from REVISION\" rather than \"execute *the*\r\n    command in REVISION\".  This has a similar behavior to\r\n    `git rebase --root`.\r\n\r\n  * The branch is rebased on top of `0.9.x` (at the request of\r\n    @yarikoptic).\r\n\r\nHere are how the examples given in #2070 would now look:\r\n\r\n  * `datalad run --rerun --revision=COMMIT`\r\n\r\n    re-run command from COMMIT with state still at HEAD.\r\n\r\n    **Now**: `datalad rerun COMMIT`\r\n\r\n  * `datalad run --rerun --revision=HEAD~10..`\r\n\r\n    re-run commands from commits that a reachable from `HEAD` but not\r\n    from `HEAD~10`, keeping HEAD's state.\r\n\r\n    **Now**: `datalad rerun HEAD~10..`\r\n\r\n  * `datalad run --rerun --branch=rerun --revision=HEAD~10..`\r\n\r\n    Create a new branch rerun that starts at `HEAD~10` and then\r\n    replay the commands from commits in `HEAD` but not `HEAD~10`.\r\n\r\n    **Now**: `datalad rerun --branch=rerun --onto=HEAD~10 HEAD~10..`\r\n\r\n    This one has become more unwieldy because you have to specify\r\n    `HEAD~10` twice.  That's a tradeoff for the added flexibility of\r\n    being able to specify other revisions with `--onto` rather than\r\n    implicitly setting the base to the equivalent of\r\n    `--onto=<start of range>`.\r\n\r\n    Perhaps we could add a convenience option that wraps this behavior\r\n    since it would probably be a common case.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n- [x] This change is complete\r\n- [ ] This is in progress\r\n\r\nPlease have a look @datalad/developers\r\n\r\nRe: https://github.com/datalad/datalad/issues/2068#issuecomment-356978452\r\n", "closed_by": {"login": "yarikoptic", "id": 39889, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjM5ODg5", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39889?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic", "html_url": "https://github.com/yarikoptic", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/2076/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/2076/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
