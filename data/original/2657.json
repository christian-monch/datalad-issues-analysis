In the context of #2428 I keep thinking about one source of complications that we are \"causing\" ourselves: `add --nosave`.\r\n\r\nThis is a very useful feature for people that care about \"readability\" of a datasets history. I use this pretty much every day. However, I noticed that I do the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndatalad add ... --nosave\r\n...\r\ngit commit\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhere the first command stages my addition, and the final commit creates the commit and gets the dataset clean. I do this, because it is the only reliable way to achieve the outcome, given the various complications in the behavior of `add` and `save.\r\n\r\nThis has two issues:\r\n\r\n1. It breaks the paradigm, as the dataset is not clean in between the command (which might correspond to a loooong time, with intermediate memory loss on what this was about).\r\n2. it pushes me (and by extension any datalad user) to use Git directly instead of DataLad\r\n\r\nI propose to:\r\n\r\n1. discontinue the `save=` option\r\n2. replace it (and potentially enhance other commands) with an `--amend` flag.\r\n\r\nThis will achieve a few things:\r\n- anyone can commit any change right away, and incrementally build up changesets with `--amend` across individual command calls\r\n- as a consequence a dataset will tend to be clean more often\r\n- users can stay in the DataLad world for this basic management task\r\n\r\nIf we go down this path, there is even less reason for keeping `add/save` as two separate commands.", "closed_by": {"login": "mih", "id": 136479, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjQ3OQ==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/136479?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih", "html_url": "https://github.com/mih", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/2657/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/2657/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
