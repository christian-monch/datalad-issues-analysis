However, if save is False,\r\nthere's no reason to do so.  Trying to infer the dataset in these\r\nsituations generally won't hurt, but doing so may unnecessarily\r\nfail in the save=False case if the current directory is something\r\nthat may cause issues when used as a dataset (e.g., a git\r\nworktree).\r\n\r\nNote: This was prompted by a download_url test failing when ran from a\r\nworktree (gh-3028).  The most direct solution is to use chpwd() to get\r\nto a non-dataset directory in the cases that we call\r\napi.download_url(dataset=None), but that wouldn't help for callers\r\noutside the test.  Another would be to catch the repository exception\r\naround the require_dataset() call, but I've found that, when calling\r\n`datalad download-url` from a worktree, the exception may be raised\r\ndownstream rather than at the require_dataset() call.\r\n\r\nFixes #3028.", "closed_by": {"login": "yarikoptic", "id": 39889, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjM5ODg5", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39889?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic", "html_url": "https://github.com/yarikoptic", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/3029/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/3029/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
