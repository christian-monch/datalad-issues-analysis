Requires the client-side setup described below and then:\r\n   - `datalad create test`\r\n   - `datalad -d test create-sibling-ria storedataladorg`\r\n\r\n   Result now sitting at `http://store.datalad.org/76b/6ca66-36b1-11ea-a2e6-f0d5bf7b5561`\r\n- [x] make `datalad clone ria+http://store.datalad.org#76b6ca66-36b1-11ea-a2e6-f0d5bf7b5561` work\r\n   - for now I had to manually run `git update-server-info` on the server, would a smart http setup on the server help @yarikoptic ?\r\n- [x] make `datalad clone ria+ssh://store.datalad.org#76b6ca66-36b1-11ea-a2e6-f0d5bf7b5561` work\r\n  - only works with additional client-side configuration (see below), because the actual location on the server cannot be inferred from the identifier. This is not a problem, because only people with write access will need to have this, and they already need that for `ria-remote`.\r\n- [x] add tests against `store.datalad.org`\r\n   - [x] clone from http\r\n   - [x] verify required post-clone configuration is in place\r\n- [x] enhance the clone source specification decoding to also suggest a destination path.Often more clever names will be possible then just the basename derived from the final git-clone url\r\n- [x] describe `ria+http|ssh://` URIs in docs\r\n- [x] check that `ria+http` logic can deal with URLs were the store needs a path in addition to the hostname, .e.g. `example.com/mystore#dsid`", "closed_by": {"login": "mih", "id": 136479, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjQ3OQ==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/136479?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih", "html_url": "https://github.com/mih", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/4022/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/4022/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
