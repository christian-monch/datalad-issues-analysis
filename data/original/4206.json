If this is an issue, RF `_diff_cmd()` into a proper public function that we can use. it already exposes this parameter.\r\n- [x] support for recursive operation\r\n- [x] >90% test coverage\r\n- [x] path handling uniform with `status` and `diff`. Fixes gh-1726 and fixes gh-4098\r\n- [x] dedciated `action=publish` result for each pushed branch. Fixes gh-2000\r\n- [x] dedicated error result when remote branch name cannot be determined. Fixes gh-2855\r\n- [x] sync with remote annex branch after data transfer and before a push of the local git-annex branch to the remote. Fixes gh-2636\r\n- [x] always publish the main branch first, and the git-annex branch last. Fixes gh-2001\r\n- [x] no longer use `AnnexRepo.copy_to()`, but a dedicated async call with a protocol class implementing\r\nannex JSON comminucation. Results are directly reported after normalization without intermediate inspection and decision making. Fixes gh-3412\r\n- [x] if no branches are configured for push, the active branch (or rather its corresponding branch) is pushed by default. Fixes gh-1275\r\n- [x] if branches are configured to be pushed by default, such configuration is honored. Fixes gh-4006\r\n- [x] passes `--jobs` on to `git annex copy`. Fixes gh-3732\r\n- [x] can push to an empty repository, regardless of without it is just a GitRepo, a (non-bare) AnnexRepo, or even a pseudo-empty AnnexRepo in adjusted-unlock mode (were initially an unrelated commit exists to mark the state prior to the created (empty) adjusted branch). Fixes gh-4074\r\n- [x] recognized and supports non-annex datasets. Fixes gh-4082\r\n- [x] reports an `impossible` result when content should be transferred, but isn't present locally. Fixes gh-3424\r\n- [x] supports 'force' modes `datatransfer` and `nodatatransfer` (among other) that replace the clunky `--transfer-data` parameter of `publish`. Fixes gh-3414\r\n- [x] rebase should #4228 be altered\r\n- [x] rebase when #4229 is merged\r\n- [x] PR cleanup", "closed_by": {"login": "mih", "id": 136479, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjQ3OQ==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/136479?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih", "html_url": "https://github.com/mih", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/4206/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/4206/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
