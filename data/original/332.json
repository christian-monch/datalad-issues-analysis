This will only copy data that is actually present in the handle and will ignore all dead symlinks. It will also include annex-enabled submodules. This is useful if one manages data-dependency tracking via submodules. Again, only present files (i.e. actual dependency) are transferred. If a remote location is to be updated repeatedly, the `--delete` option may come handy.\n#### tar\n\nIf the handle needs to be exported into an archive tar does the job:\n\n`tar --exclude=\".git*\" -chvf DEST.tar SRC`\n\ninsert your favorite compression options as you see fit. Note that this command will return with a non-zero exit code if tar encounters dead symlinks. However, it will still complete the job and ignore them like rsync does.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "mih", "id": 136479, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjQ3OQ==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/136479?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih", "html_url": "https://github.com/mih", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/332/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/332/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
