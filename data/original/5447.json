I think it should be safe to assume that if underlying `git-annex get` which managed to produce some progress output etc, dies with 9 or 11 (SIGSEGV), is not a \"normal\" operation/exit of git-annex.  But since `git annex get` is \"idempotent\" - we could just safely restart it for another attempt.\r\n\r\nThat would provide a pragmatically useful resilience in cases where `datalad` is used in environments which impose some limits on user processes (e.g. total cpu run time).\r\n\r\nNegative side-effect could be - difficulty to \"kill intentionally\".  May be such behavior should be instrumented by a config variable (e.g. `runtime.git.retry=3` or alike?)\r\n\r\nWDYT?", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/5447/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/5447/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
