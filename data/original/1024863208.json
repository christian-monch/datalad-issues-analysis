This is undesirable. As outlined in https://github.com/datalad/datalad/pull/5969#pullrequestreview-778137010 to path towards resolving #5489 will break many calls to the `Dataset|Repo.config` API, and require substantial additional RF in extension and user code.\r\n\r\nWe should avoid future additional breakage and tackle a de-duplication of the config manipulation API within the deprecation cycle started by #5969.\r\n\r\nI propose that `ConfigManager` is replaced in `Dataset|Repo.config` with an alternative implementation that is tailored to the purpose of fast, repeated config look-ups (i.e. read-only), while all configuration manipulation is exclusively done by the `configuration` command coming with #5489.\r\n\r\nImportantly, `Dataset|Repo.config` will then only be necessary for performance-criticial \"internal\" internal implementations, while all other access (read or write) can be made via `.configuration`, homogeneously in both cmdline and Python API.\r\n\r\nConsequently, users should be informed with the next major release that user code should switch to `.configuration`, instead of changing `where=` to `scope=`.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/6071/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/6071/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
