Objectives:\n1. Compact\n2. Suitable for hand-editing (we have two JSON-based ones already)\n3. Flexible enough to be able to capture pretty much anything I could think of\n\nChoosing Debian's RFC822 felt natural. Pretty much all these files are composed by hand (that's proof enough).\n\nThe idea is to merge the various ideas from Debian's metadata files into a single spec file (control, copyright, ...). If necessary, we could have multiple files of course, but it doesn't look like we need it (yet).\n\nAt this point, the implementation represents the minimal technical infrastructure to support this format on a demo level, and to get the discussion going.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "mih", "id": 136479, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjQ3OQ==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/136479?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih", "html_url": "https://github.com/mih", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/1023/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/1023/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
