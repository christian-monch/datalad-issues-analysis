well\n- [x] tests must be fixed\n- [x] additional tests (may be as well mocked up) for install to invoke correct actions (e.g. calling get)\n- [x] Issues which came up while testing #959 (I think all were addressed by @mih or by me by now)\n- [x] Should close #1000 \n- [x] Should close #1001 \n- [x] Decide possibly how to avoid having `_`-prefixed argument in `Get.__call__`  (discussed with @bpoldrack , and agreed that if needs changing, could be done later)\n- [x] Provide documentation outlining similarities and differences between `install` and `get` commands\n- [x] add `-J` (jobs) option to `install` to pass to `get`\n\nFor future PRs\n- Unify options between `get` and `install` APIs more  addressing those commented out ones which are specific only to get or to install currently\n\nhttps://github.com/mih/datalad/pull/13 shows changes on top of original (and improved) rf-getinstall from @mih\n", "closed_by": {"login": "yarikoptic", "id": 39889, "node_id":
