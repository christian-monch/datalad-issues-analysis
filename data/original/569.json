Actually, it does it properly, and ignores them largely -- just like empty directories. However, in our context this causes pain and complications (see #558, but we have been there before already).\n\nThe \"easy\" way out is to never have empty repositories by making an initial commit. The naive choice for the content of such commit is an initial set of meta data (remember?). At this point I don't want to repeat the \"what could the minimal meta data set be?\" question.\n\nFortunately, we have a concrete case this time: \"description\". Unlike the suggestion in #564, I propose to store a given description for a new dataset in our own meta data file in `.datalad` (or whereever we agreed that thing to be). Let's ignore the linked data topic for now and go simple with this one. I'd prefer YAML as a format, but I don't feel strongly about it.\n\nI do not see this meta data file as exclusive. We should continue to set a description via git-annex (although this rather has to be seen as a description for an annex clone, and not so much a description of the dataset itself).\n\nYes, no, maybe?\n", "closed_by": {"login": "mih", "id": 136479, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjQ3OQ==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/136479?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih", "html_url": "https://github.com/mih", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/569/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/569/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
