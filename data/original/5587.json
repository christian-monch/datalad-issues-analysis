I believe what is missing for a long time is a call-by-call ability to pass config overrides. If we had that, uniformly for cmdline and Python, fixes for issues like #5586 would be straightforward.\r\n\r\nATM our use of configuration options is fairly minimal, given the possible ways we could tweak things. I suspect this is primarily due to the inability to perform per-call config overrides in a Python session. In this context, it would require tweaking the session/dataset config manager with some kind of context manager. At the same time, this is trivial to do in the cmdline.\r\n\r\nI think a new 'common' option that is accessible from Python too for offer a lot of flexbility.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/5587/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/5587/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
