It also means that the request URLs now use paths for annexed objects according to the specified layout, whereas before we'd always send the same request and it was up to the server to consider its layout and deliver the right thing.\r\n\r\nHTTP stores are validated on `annex initremote`/`annex enableremote` the same way they are when using `ssh:` or `file:` scheme URLs.
