The leads to less tests being implemented, and implemented test to run less often then desired.\r\n\r\nI would appreciate if we could host a series of HTTP server(s) (virtual hosts), something like `ci-test-<scenario>.datalad.org` that are available to test against a number of predefined scenarios.\r\n\r\nTheir availability would be beneficial for the RIA-related functionality. With all other supported \"services\" we have deployments to test against, not for RIA. All is done adhoc, and nowhere complete enough.\r\n\r\nI would appreciate your feedback on how this could be achieved. A preconfigured container might be a possibility (to keep it within the context of a CI and always fresh). But a static deployment is also an option.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/5791/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/5791/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
