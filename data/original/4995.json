But I think in many scenarios (in particular for e.g. `mv` #1193) it would beneficial to support a \"full transfer\" which also probably could be faster and not even require data to be present locally to instantiate keys in destination (git files should be copied)\r\n\r\n- key (symlink) is copied to the destination dataset (possibly under a different name/path)\r\n- information from `git-annex` branch for the key is copied into `git-annex` branch of destination\r\n  - need to look out for [the `annex.tune` options](https://git-annex.branchable.com/tuning/) which AFAIK we have not used but could be defined\r\n- (special) remotes information should also be copied (if not yet known at destination) based on the UUIDs found in the key annex .lo\r\n- backend of the key doesn't need to match the default really, just need to be supported\r\n\r\n", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/4995/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/4995/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
