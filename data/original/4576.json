Among other things, I plan to introduce Datalad and show why this is the winning bet for now and the future. Besides the technical approach which is clear to me, I need to give a layout of the future. So far, I only know Datalad comes from a USA-German collaboration, but not much else. Where can I find some more details on \r\nhow many people work on it (full time, part time?), how much funding it currently has, and how long there is funding to keep going on. That is, I am trying to get a long term view of where datalad is going with some concrete details to back up my personal enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nAlso, is there any set of slides from past presentations I can borrow? I found some slides from @adswa [here](https://github.com/datalad-handbook/course/tree/master/talks), not sure if there is something else.\r\n\r\nAnother question:\r\nAre HCP and UK Biobank datasets fully up for retrieval via datalad now?\r\n\r\n\r\n#### What steps will reproduce the problem?\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n#### What version of DataLad are you using (run `datalad --version`)? On what operating system (consider running `datalad wtf`)?\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n#### Is there anything else that would be useful to know in this context?\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n#### Have you had any success using DataLad before? (to assess your expertise/prior luck.  We would welcome your testimonial additions to https://github.com/datalad/datalad/wiki/Testimonials as well)\r\nThis is it :)", "closed_by": {"login": "dorianps", "id": 9083517, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjkwODM1MTc=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9083517?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/dorianps", "html_url": "https://github.com/dorianps", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dorianps/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dorianps/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dorianps/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dorianps/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dorianps/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dorianps/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dorianps/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dorianps/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dorianps/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/4576/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/4576/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
