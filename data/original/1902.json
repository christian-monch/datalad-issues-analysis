If I know that there were no changes in datalad, and metadata aggregation was already the last commit in a repo, there is no need to re-aggregate there.   Not sure if `--since` semantic kinda fits here... so may be `--skip-aggregated` would be more appropriate here... or may be skipping should be the default , and `--force` should be added to signal to re-aggregate even if meta-data aggregation was the last step.  May be it is worth storing datalad's version within aggregated meta-data so we could also trigger reaggregation automagically (and record new version) if new datalad is used\r\n\r\nedit 1: #850 originally requested `--since` for aggregate-metadata, so changing title to list only --skip aggregated", "closed_by": {"login": "mih", "id": 136479, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjQ3OQ==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/136479?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih", "html_url": "https://github.com/mih", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/1902/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/1902/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
