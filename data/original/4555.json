With this approach results will appear above any active progress bar in the terminal and do not get half-swallowed by a progress update.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/datalad/datalad/pull/4444#issuecomment-620285637 outlines an additional improvement that addresses the analog issue for the interaction of log messages and progress reporting, also pointed out by (but unaddressed in) gh-4444.
