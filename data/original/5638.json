Then datasets could carry desired weighting within their `.datalad/config`.\r\n\r\nOr, we could be \"smarty pants\" and just (via historical collection in cache, e.g. of the recent X size: time pairs per each `protocol://servername` we encountered) figure out which of the domains (URLs) is expected to be the \"fastest\" one.  I feel like we had some issue about that but failed to find it.  Such automagical decision making would be nice, but would be hard to \"inherit\"/propagate across different CI runs (one of the use cases e.g. `annex fsck` for https://github.com/dandi/dandisets/issues/11#issuecomment-831993490) and might need some clever design to not derail into choosing the suboptimal/slowest one.\r\n\r\nMay be that logic could even be reused for `clone` operation while going through candidates with the same priority.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/5638/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/5638/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
