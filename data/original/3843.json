So if my algebra is right -- to double free on Linux only, we need to pay 16$/mo (or twice more if Windows only).\r\n\r\nBut the real question is how many minutes we consume typically, or how many we consumed so far?  I found no summary anywhere. Emailed support@github.\r\n\r\nBut also -- I see from https://github.com/pricing that \"Team\", which has 10,000 (so 5x) minutes per month allowance, would be 25$/mo (for 5 team members), BUT also it is \"Free to academic faculty for teaching or non-profit research\".  So at least we could inquire may be about getting core developers some Team privileges?\r\nThere is even a bigger carrot where one of us would need to sell someone's in administration soul to github -- https://education.github.com/schools which makes enterprise level github available for free, and that would be 50,000 minutes! ;)", "closed_by": {"login": "mih", "id": 136479, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjQ3OQ==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/136479?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih", "html_url": "https://github.com/mih", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/3843/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/3843/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
