ATM primarily for a use with `datalad run` (or `rerun`) where the underlying command populates some new directory worth placing into a subdataset (e.g. a new subject within a huge BIDS dataset etc)\r\n\r\nI see this feature also potentially useful for addurls as a more flexible (than the `//` in the target filepath it currently supports) way to define when to create a new subdataset, and potentially later to be used for datalad-crawler.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n[datalad.save.subdataset \"allsubdstext2git\"]\r\n\tregexes = ^[^/]*/\r\n\tcfg = text2git\r\n```\r\n\r\nthere could be multiple such sections with custom `\"names\"` to provide most of the flexibility.\r\n\r\nMay be something like that is already achievable with the hooks somehow?\r\n\r\ncons:\r\n- this setting will reside only in the parent super-dataset and not propagate into subdatasets.  Coding/testing should be done so that behavior is well defined, e.g. if subdatasets define their own settings, they are respected as well and probably are in effect before super-dataset consideration (but that might be tricky)", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/5423/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/5423/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
