How do I delete annex files from ALL past commits? Yes, I know that I can't roll back to earlier commits anymore, but I don't need to keep around old file versions that are corrupt.\r\n2. Related to the first but more specific. I plan to distribute the data every once in a while, and I plan to mark version tag the released commit so we know exactly at which points we gave the data out. Thus, I need to keep annex content of some (tagged) commits so I can roll back as needed if someone asks for that specific version of the data. But I do not need (or like) to keep file content for commits between the released commits. Is there a way to drop all content linked to commits between two commits A and B?\r\n3. It is still unclear to me what happens when I install a dataset from somewhere and get the files? Does the `get` command get all the content even from past commits, or just the current one? I am asking because I will need to just distribute a version of the data from a specific commit, not all past annex content.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### What steps will reproduce the problem?\r\nNA\r\n\r\n#### What version of DataLad are you using (run `datalad --version`)? On what operating system (consider running `datalad wtf`)?\r\n0.12.2\r\n\r\n#### Is there anything else that would be useful to know in this context?\r\nNA\r\n\r\n#### Have you had any success using DataLad before?
