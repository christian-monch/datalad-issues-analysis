In many use cases datalad commands flood the screen with \"per file\" reports which aren't really of interest when manipulating large number of files, and then (some) commands  provide the actually useful in those use cases \"action summary:\" statements.  I think it would be nice if there was an output format (possibly eventually becoming the default one, with \"oneline\" being the current one) which\r\n- after a configurable number of lines have been output (let's say 10) it would say something like\r\n\"... more than 10 records, only summary will be displayed, see /tmp/datalad-output-RANDOM.log for full list\"\r\n- that temporary file is not auto-removed\r\n- in a TTY/interactive mode we could add some progress indicator for more records being received without flooding the screen\r\n- at the end display \"action summary:\"\r\n\r\nan alternative flavor is to store in that file not pre-formatted log lines, but actual records, and have a dedicated command (e.g. `datalad cmdlog`) being able to load and render them with an alternative `--output-format`, with `\"oneline\"` being the default one.\r\n\r\nThis way output from datalad will not flood terminals, all log messages will still be accessible if necessary, for programmable handling the other modes of `-f` would remain available", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/3503/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/3503/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
