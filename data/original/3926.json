As a result, if data is only in A, C will fail to retrieve the data with `datalad get`. This is somewhat counter intuitive because a new install should know in theory about other copies of the dataset and be able to retrieve the data from one of the copy locations. It also forces the users that need to be parsimonious on storage to clone from A only, at whichever status that is.\r\n\r\n#### What steps will reproduce the problem?\r\nI can provide tomorrow some code if the problem is not easy to reproduce.\r\n\r\n#### What version of DataLad are you using (run `datalad --version`)? On what operating system (consider running `datalad wtf`)?\r\n0.12.rc6\r\n\r\n#### Is there anything else that would be useful to know in this context?\r\nNot sure how this can be resolved, maybe adding more git-annex locations for each file, or perhaps by adding the remote A during the install process from B to C. In principle though, new installs should always be able to scout the data even when a clone is cloned.\r\n\r\n#### Have you had any success using DataLad before?
