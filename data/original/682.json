The `name` properties are coming from a BIDS structure (presence of BIDS metadata was auto-detected), the rest comes from Git/Git-annex itself.\n\nThe goal here is to get a list (one item per dataset) of dicts with a more-or-less plain key-value mapping (no nested structures) -- `@id` being the only and necessary exception to get valid JSON-LD. Such metadata structure should be easily convertible into a queryable form (SQL, or NO-SQL, etc).\n\nConfession:\n\nThe above is not quiet true, as this is a compacted and flattened graph, for which a call to pyld's `jsonld.flatten()` is not yet pushed. This is a rather expensive call (needs network (or local cache) for term resolution), but it allows us to condense pretty much arbitrary metadata sets into a minimal form. It only needs to be done when metadata is aggregated and cached, not for query. pyld is in Debian and available through pip.\n\nIn contrast to what I said before, I now think we should store metadata as JSON-LD and not as triples. JSON-LD can get us triples if we need them. But JSON-LD is plain JSON, hence we can limit metadata read requirements to just `json`, and do not need to worry about JSON-LD.\n\nIf you want to play with the formats look here: http://tinyurl.com/jb62uhu\nThe top show the actual metadata structure generated by the current code. Various other flavors are available at the bottom. For expansion to triples/quads the UUIDs would get prefixed with something like `http://db.datalad.org/ds/`. Where we could provide information on the datasets that we know. The fact that the UUID are clone-specific should not hurt. The current PR already stores the origin UUID for newly created datasets, and the graph info would allow us to trace clones.\n\nMore info:  http://json-ld.org\n\nTODO:\n- cache metadata\n- retrieve cached metadata for query, instead of reparse\n", "closed_by": {"login": "mih", "id": 136479, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjQ3OQ==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/136479?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih", "html_url": "https://github.com/mih", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/682/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/682/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
