However, using `diff` for modification detection within `annotate-paths` requires that too. On one hand, we want `annotate-path` to `diff` recorded history (e.g. in the context of deciding if a `publish` is needed), on the other hand we want to discover dirty bits in a dataset (e.g. in the context of #1720). As `annotate-paths` is unaware of the context it should be able to do both.\r\n\r\nI propose to: whenever no commit range is given (e.g. not HEAD~2..HEAD, but just HEAD), `datalad diff` also reports any untracked content, and does so via an additional call to `git --work-tree=. status --untracked=all --porcelain --ignore-submodules=all`. This should work in direct mode too.\r\n\r\nTogether with this change, `diff` must also grow some basic unit tests.", "closed_by": {"login": "mih", "id": 136479, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjQ3OQ==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/136479?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih", "html_url": "https://github.com/mih", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/1723/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/1723/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
