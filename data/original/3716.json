While the failure\r\nseems specific for this tests (down to the same spot), the source of\r\nthe problem isn't clear.  The test and underlying code in run.py\r\nhaven't been modified for a while, so there are no obvious culprits on\r\nour side.  I haven't had any luck triggering the failure by running\r\nthe tests 30x locally using git-annex 7.20190912.\r\n\r\nLet's see if we can work around this failure with a sleep.  Fixing the\r\nerror would of course be better, but until we can make progress with\r\nthat (e.g., a reliable recipe to trigger it locally), having a known\r\nfailure pop up intermittently is problematic because it makes it more\r\nlikely that unknown/relevant failures will be overlooked.\r\n```\r\n\r\nRe: #3653\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI'm marking this as a draft because it's not clear this is actually an effective workaround.  It'd be good to see at least one run actually uses the workaround, which may require restarting the entire travis build.", "closed_by": {"login": "kyleam", "id": 1297788, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTc3ODg=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1297788?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam", "html_url": "https://github.com/kyleam", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/3716/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/3716/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
