ATM we run the tests on the result of `setup.py build` and only after the tests ran, we try to install.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, we offer a `test` command that is designed to pick up the installed tests.\r\n\r\nWith the new extension setup things become even weirder, as they need to be installed in order for the entrypoints to have any effect.\r\n\r\nIf there is any benefit to testing the non-installed datalad over the installed one, please let me know.
