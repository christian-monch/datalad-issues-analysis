The question is whether it has a real purpose?\r\n\r\nWhen any paths are given (at least when they are not datasets), I clearly want data transfer.\r\n\r\nIf I do not want data transfer, I can only act on the granularity of whole datasets anyways, so I can use `--dataset` instead of a `path`.\r\n\r\nI would not be able to specify multiple individual datasets to publish at once in this scenario. However, there is not real requirement to support that, as multiple calls to `publish`, each for a single (root) dataset accomplish the job -- potentially much faster, as these operations are independent of each other.\r\n\r\nAll other scenarios I can think of would be covered by adding particular modes for `--force` #3414, including the case that if we want to transfer all data by default, without requiring `.` as path argument, we can have `--force nodatatransfer` as a way to prevent this.
