It adds a safe-guard to check whether a sibling-name to-be already exists, and errors out instead of overwriting it. I believe that this should be non-controversial, as it mirrors the way the other ``create-sibling-``s work. However, the comments seem to indicate that there is something special going on with GitLab, and the tests required some larger changes. I would therefore be very grateful if @mih (who has written code I have now changed) could check my changes carefully.\r\n", "closed_by": {"login": "adswa", "id": 29738718, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI5NzM4NzE4", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29738718?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/adswa", "html_url": "https://github.com/adswa", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/adswa/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/adswa/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/adswa/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/adswa/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/adswa/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/adswa/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/adswa/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/adswa/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/adswa/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/6015/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/6015/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
