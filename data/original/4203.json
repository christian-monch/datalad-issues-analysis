Furthermore split store from dataset representation in that regard, meaning two creation routines (one for a store and its layout and for a dataset within a store and its layout)\r\n - [x] rewrite tests\r\n - [x] New concept of storing rewritten URL in special remote config and its uuid in the bare repo's config in a store. `clone` gets a fallback solution in `postclone_ria` in case we cloned from a RIA store and `annex-init` didn't enable an ORA remote. We would now look for an ORA remote UUID in origin's config and try to enable this one using the `ria+` URL we cloned from. This is useful for example when the special remote URL used to publish to the store isn't valid from the point of view of a consumer. Note, that this currently supports `file:` and `ssh:` URLS. Meaningful `http:`support depends on actual support for HTTP in the special remote itself.\r\n - [x] renaming of the special remote and related configs, etc. from RIA to ORA. Includes command renaming `ria-export-archive` to `ora-export-archive`\r\n- [x] exclude `@turtle` tests in AppVeyor, too. Not just in Travis.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is still some RF'ing to do and issues like #4436 and #4437 to address/investigate. However, this should be based on the remaining RF'ing which depends on PR #4068. Plan is to build a remote execution abstraction using the approach of `SSHRemoteIO` in the special remote but with the async based new runner.\r\n\r\n", "closed_by": {"login": "yarikoptic", "id": 39889, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjM5ODg5", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39889?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic", "html_url": "https://github.com/yarikoptic", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/4203/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/4203/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
