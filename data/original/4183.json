There are two basic paradigm that I can see re how to integrate that with the rest of the code base.\r\n\r\n- add pieces of functionality to existing commands where they make sense (an example of a first step is #4162 by @adswa)\r\n- centralize gdrive-focused functionality in a dedicated command and keep the others clean(er)\r\n\r\nThere are advantages to both approach, but also disadvantages. In #4162 we can see how, an already complex `siblings` needs to be blown up. With the `create-sibling*()` family I see more evidence that uniformity is not practical. And `publish` is not (yet) in the position to be extended to anything beyond `git/git-annex` `push/pull/copy`.\r\n\r\nI am currently investigating an alternative path, where I am trying to use git-remote helpers to give native access to a gdrive via an rclone mount.
