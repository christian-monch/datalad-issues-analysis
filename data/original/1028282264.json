This is clearly unspecified behavior (other functions might behave in unexpected ways as well if unexpected parameter types are supplied, leading to performance problems or inconsistencies, although that is just a guess and has to be confirmed).\r\n\r\nIt would be good to ensure type-compliance in the called function, e.g. by asserting types or by `typing.cast`. That would detect certain classes of faulty use and potentially increase stability.\r\n\r\nThis issue is related to or #6075 \r\n\n\n### What steps will reproduce the problem?\n\nCall me `get_content_annexinfo` with a string as argument.\n\n### Datalad information\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_\n\n### Have you had any success using DataLad before?\n\n_No response_", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/6087/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/6087/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
