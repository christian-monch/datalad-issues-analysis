I have a nested structure of datasets, say parent A with children B and C. When I install A recursively (`datalad install -r --source /PATH/TO/A`) I end up with an older copy of A which does not contain some of the subdatasets (say, missing C which was added at a later commit). I can't understand why is this happening, any idea?\r\n\r\nAs a result, also the subdatasets are outdated, example below:\r\n\r\n```\r\n### original source location\r\n[dorian@mri STUDY1]$ git submodule\r\n+5c62264b5d7ebe119deeeb2a08ebc8f1d49afd63 data/bids (v0.9-GoodImages)\r\n 8a3f036fdbd18092661d4fe16071d3f962627ab5 data/processed (v0.5)\r\n### new install location\r\n[dorian@mri STUDY1]$ cd /DATA/dorian/datasets/STUDY1/\r\n[dorian@mri STUDY1]$ git submodule\r\n 2e335c4720e60b0408f9496fb51b23a6dbb1e521 data/bids (v0.5~22)\r\n 8c38621bd1925baabd69953e2c114b438eda8ab5 data/processed (v0.5~7)\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### What steps will reproduce the problem?\r\nHopefully this does not need a reproducible example.\r\n\r\n#### What version of DataLad are you using (run `datalad --version`)? On what operating system (consider running `datalad wtf`)?   \r\n`datalad 0.14.0`\r\n\r\n#### Is there anything else that would be useful to know in this context?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n#### Have you had any success using DataLad before?
