Such message should indicate the start and end of a process, as well as intermediate updates on the progress. Start messages may also give an indication of the \"amount\" of processing to be expected, and log messages could indicate a more precise state of the progress in such cases.\r\n\r\nWith such messages and related adjustments it would be possible to uniformly display progress (in contrast to the current mix of logging and progress reporting. We could decide centrally to disable any of that, rate limit progress reports, or switch between progressbars, no progressbars, or line-based log messages. It would also enable us to adopt the habit of using logging in a more structured way -- not with the target of communicating with a user, but to comprehensively document what is going on.\r\n\r\n@bpoldrack you looked at logging in the past, correct? Could you look into whether we can have a log handler that could receive dicts with such info as input?", "closed_by": {"login": "mih", "id": 136479, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjQ3OQ==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/136479?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih", "html_url": "https://github.com/mih", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/2351/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/2351/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
