That commit\r\npointed to a passing build [0].  Checking that build again, it does\r\nlook good: it gets through the entire test suite, including\r\ntest_annex_ssh, *on Xenial* with a very recent git-annex.\r\nNevertheless, test_annex_ssh has since shown a failure on Xenial but\r\nnot on Bionic [1].  Based on a few runs, the stall is consistent, so\r\nit's not clear what's going on.\r\n\r\nIn a Xenial VM, I bisected the stall to git-annex's 75059c9f3 (better\r\nerror message when git config fails to parse remote config,\r\n2020-01-22).  I've opened a git-annex report about that commit [1],\r\nthough it's possible that the reproducer (which doesn't involve\r\nDataLad) may not actually be showing the same issue that is causing\r\ntest_annex_ssh to hang.\r\n\r\nFollow the same approach as 64c279ca9 (TST: with_sameas_remote: Skip\r\non older systems, 2020-07-07), and skip the test when using a newer\r\ngit-annex *and* running on a system with an older openssh.\r\n\r\n[0] https://travis-ci.org/github/datalad/datalad/jobs/705850665\r\n    Another passing run for that PR's tree is here:\r\n    https://travis-ci.org/github/datalad/datalad/builds/705920487\r\n[1] https://travis-ci.org/github/datalad/datalad/builds/706998369\r\n[2] https://git-annex.branchable.com/bugs/SSH-based_git-annex-init_hang_on_older_systems___40__Xenial__44___Jessie__41__/\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n- [x] Drop tip commit that tests with latest git-annex on Xenial and Bionic.", "closed_by": {"login": "kyleam", "id": 1297788, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTc3ODg=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1297788?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam", "html_url": "https://github.com/kyleam", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/4688/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/4688/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
