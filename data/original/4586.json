I developed this interactively and used a different error that I could trigger with:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ndatalad --cmd search\r\n```\r\n\r\nI wasn't sure what kind of real use case would lead to the last error, so I was only able to get there by commenting out the other exceptions. It would be good to have a few examples to trigger the error so I can test the final thing **and** add an example to the user docs. Interactively, the example issue is here https://github.com/datalad/datalad-helpme/issues/4. \r\n\r\n## Fixes\r\n - #3649 \r\n - #3942\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\nChanges include:\r\n\r\n - a reporting.rst documentation page to describe helpme and how it works with datalad\r\n - a submit_helpme function defined in datalad/cmdline/support.py, which doesn't trigger an error if helpme isn't installed (just skips over)\r\n - adding helpme to install under misc (note that the github and base of helpme only requires requests, which is already required by datalad)\r\n - an envar `DATALAD_HELPME_DISABLE` that the user can set to disable it.\r\n - instructions for exporting `HELPME_GITHUB_TOKEN` if they don't want the interactive submission.\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: vsoch <vsochat@stanford.edu", "closed_by": {"login": "mih", "id": 136479, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjQ3OQ==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/136479?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih", "html_url": "https://github.com/mih", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/4586/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/4586/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
