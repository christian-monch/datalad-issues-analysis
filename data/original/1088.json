So I have changed it so it does `git add` in pure git repos, instead of returning failure\r\n- GitRepo.add didn't return anything, at least with recent git 2.9.3 unless --verbose option is added\r\n- parsing of the add output was not working correctly for obscure filenames with ' in them\r\n- `datalad add` was returning (I think) incorrect results in case of paths across multiple datasets were provided, since the last lucky `ds` value was used. Since output was not really tested much -- that bug was lingering happily around.  I have added some testing\r\n\r\nP.S. now I just need to remember what the heck I was doing that I got to this issue ;)  ah, right -- I was under ~/datalad and was trying to save a bogus file so I could trigger regeneration of metadata cache. but was surprised that command seemingly succeeded but file was not added to git at all.", "closed_by": {"login": "yarikoptic", "id": 39889, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjM5ODg5", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39889?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic", "html_url": "https://github.com/yarikoptic", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/1088/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/1088/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
