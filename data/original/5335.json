It is intentionally not aiming to be a single step towards a \"solution\". There are many TODOs (the flyweight either needs to change, or we agree that these classes are not meant to be used directly (yet), outside the tests). Moreover, I have no desire to discontinue the traditional `GitRepo` class. The aim is to mirror the distinction between the `core` API and the rest of of Datalad, simply  installing a higher level of hesitation for changes, and a chance to (re)start with something less than 4k lines.\r\n\r\nOverall, this is little more than just moving existing code, except for:\r\n\r\n- [x] dedicated set of tests that actually test the core class, and do not need the other class API to function\r\n  - [x] `assert_repo_status()` should function with just the core repo API\r\n- [x] unify `is_valid_git()` and `is_valid_repo()` to `is_valid()`\r\n- [x] a `ConfigManager` is available under `.cfg` to eventually make room for a `config` command\r\n- [x] `get_content_info()` -> `ls_state()`\r\n  - [x] `ls_state()` needs `get_submodules_()`\r\n  - [x] `ls_state()` calls no-op `precommit()`\r\n  - [x] `ls_state()` used `BatchedCommand` which needs a plain `str` path (also #5336)\r\n- [x] `diffstatus()` -> `compare_states()`\r\n  - [x] `compare_states()` used plain `str` path as a cache key", "closed_by": {"login": "mih", "id": 136479, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjQ3OQ==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/136479?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih", "html_url": "https://github.com/mih", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/5335/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/5335/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
