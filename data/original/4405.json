That was fixed on git-annex's side, but one of the tests (`test_AnnexRepo_always_commit`) still fails due to making unwarranted (IMO) assumptions about git-annex's behavior.  The first patch brings the test into a passing state with the latest git-annex ([8.20200330-101-ga7840c0e0 AKA 8.20200501~54](https://git.kitenet.net/index.cgi/git-annex.git/commit/?id=a7840c0e0)).
