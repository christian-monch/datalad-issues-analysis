It might be that one of the initial use-cases was a \"subdataset\" which is just symlinked from another location? because otherwise I think we could have just used/report full dereferenced path.  Overall - not sure now what problem we were/are solving besides reporting the full path user expects to see whenever in his shell he is within such a symlinked directory.\r\n\r\nAnd now I wonder what should we do in respect to the original problem that we are not really in full control of current directory.  I see possibilities\r\n\r\n- in `getpwd` verify that envvar PWD and `os.getpwd()` point to the same directory (after realpath'ing it), and if not - return `os.getpwd()` (with some warning?).\r\n- completely eliminate reliance on PWD and use `getpwd()`.  That might ruin that use-case which might no longer exist, and would cause a somewhat confusing reported paths not matching what user expects (e.g. on OSX IIRC users' homes might be symlinked etc)\r\n  ", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/2910/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/2910/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
