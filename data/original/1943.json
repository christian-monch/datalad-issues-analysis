In case of `stub` (trickier I guess, but should be doable since we are instructing filename within archive anyways) we would need to replace those files with content `Content of the file was not included into the export. Contact original owner` or something like that.  Although while thinking about #1944 -- stripping is the easiest, since 'stub' would complicate bringing those files back into git-annex.
