It was added because we aimed for \"always-clean\" datasets. A result of our recent discussions was that we aim to be able to deal with any amount of dirtyness and do \"surgical\" operations.\r\n\r\nConsequently, I propose to remove `if_dirty` form all commands. It adds a serious burden regarding the serial order of processing that needs to be applies and complicates dataset interdependencies. So unless there is a very strong argument, why we cannot live without it, I see no reason to pay the complexity price for it.\r\n\r\nQuickish feedback would be appreciated @bpoldrack @yarikoptic ", "closed_by": {"login": "mih", "id": 136479, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjQ3OQ==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/136479?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih", "html_url": "https://github.com/mih", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/1175/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/1175/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
