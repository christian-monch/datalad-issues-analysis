We have minimal \"getting started\", a substantial amount of front-loading (\"principles\", etc), (too) few usage scenario descriptions (but presently in too much detail to work as intro docs), and somewhat comprehensive command/module reference docs (that aim at people that already know that they want to use datalad, and how to approach it, in principle).\r\n\r\nI am debating for a while now what structure would be most suitable for intro docs. Clearly, given the bandwidth of interesting use cases and target audience heterogeneity, a single monolithic tutorial piece would not work. Currently, I think that we would be best served with many small **standalone** demo bits that can be cross-linked into short intro bits that are targeting a specific subset of users (giving us the possibility to weight particular aspects differently). At the same time, we should be able to more easily provide adequate documentation for a specific subset of users (e.g. workshop attendees with a certain homogeneous background) without having to restructure docs each time, or to burden the generic docs with special interest topics.\r\n\r\nHere are some initial thoughts on topics and audiences -- in no particular order (yet), and with the intention to grow based on your input. thanks!\r\n\r\nPotential audiences (non-exclusive, letter code used for association with topics):\r\n\r\n- Git users (G)\r\n- Git annex users (A)\r\n- Software developers (D)\r\n- Scientists AKA people with data management needs (S)\r\n- Data portal managers (M)\r\n\r\nTopics:\r\n\r\n- basic version control for large files [S]\r\n- seemless subdataset handling for basic operations (add, rm, diff, ...) [G, A, D, S]\r\n- advanced version control for a collection of datasets [S, M]\r\n- data discovery via metadata search [S, M]\r\n- make data available by posting the git repo on Github while benefiting from all of annex' versatility to exchange the data content (box.com, gdrive, sneakernet,...) [A, D, S]\r\n- monitoring a non-datalad data resource on the web [S, M]\r\n  - get PDF \"attachments\" #38 [S]\r\n- data backup/archive #1600 \r\n- extend datalad with plugins [D, M]\r\n- \"export\" a datalad dataset to a regular bunch of files to give it to normal people [S, M]\r\n- supervisor/supervisee workflow, for, e.g., let students safely work with some parts of precious (local) datasets, and to be able to easily clean up and save the essence of their work once a thesis project is done [S]\r\n\r\nWhile there is no absolute need to impose a rule that all documentation should be using the command line interface, I nevertheless think we are best served with docs that demo the command line interface to a) get it more tested, and b) not limit the audience to python folk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n", "closed_by": {"login": "mih", "id": 136479, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjQ3OQ==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/136479?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih", "html_url": "https://github.com/mih", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/1689/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/1689/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
