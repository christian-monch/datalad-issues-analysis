It occurred to me that it would be very nice to have a Git history visualization tool (like git-big-picture or https://github.com/kidpixo/git_history_visualizer) that we can just point to a dataset(-hierarchy) and get a nice overview picture. If we would have that, we could use sphinx-gallery to get a whole zoo of nicely visualized use case docs. I think for sphinx gallery it would be necessary to use a matplotlib based visualization.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/3266/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/3266/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
