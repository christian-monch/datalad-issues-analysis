That includes absolute paths with drive letters on Windows. They just have to use forward-slashes consistently and not mix and match back- and forward-slashes.\r\n\r\nThis  is just a test to verify that. But now we should move towards a consistent path handling. IMHO that requires two things:\r\n\r\n1. stop using `os.path`, but use `posixpath` exclusively.\r\n2. establish a layer (plus helper function) that converts any incoming path to a posix-like path, regardless of platform.\r\n\r\nHere is a thing you are probably wondering about:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> import posixpath\r\n>>> p='C:/users/mike'\r\n>>> posixpath.relpath(p, 'C:/users')\r\n'mike'\r\n>>> posixpath.relpath(p, 'C:/')\r\n'users/mike'\r\n```", "closed_by": {"login": "mih", "id": 136479, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjQ3OQ==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/136479?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih", "html_url": "https://github.com/mih", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/2653/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/2653/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
