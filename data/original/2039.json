Eventually, after the Ultimate DB is complete (if ever), we could then expand `download-url` etc functionality to query the db for urls given the query of interest (either as boring as a checksum or some meta-data based query)\r\n- `ls` to list S3 buckets content reusing authentication information DataLad \"maintains\"\r\n\r\nSimilarly, we could refactor our \"uploaders\" (for zenodo, figshare, etc) so they could be used even outside of the dataset content.  This way even some plugins could/should be useable outside of the datasets content (e.g. export_archive_ export_to_figshare, etc) Sure thing they would not benefit from all additional features dataset/git repo provides (e.g. meta-data) but quite often that might not be needed/desired/available.\r\n", "closed_by": {"login": "yarikoptic", "id": 39889, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjM5ODg5", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39889?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic", "html_url": "https://github.com/yarikoptic", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/2039/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/2039/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
