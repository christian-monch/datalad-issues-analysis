To my surprise call to `datalad metadata` instead of showing known one, started to download all (?) data files for some reason (sized to 4GB).\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n$> datalad install ///labs/haxby/attention              \r\ninstall(notneeded): /tmp/attention (dataset) [dataset <Dataset path=/tmp/attention> was already cloned from 'http://datasets.datalad.org/labs/haxby/attention']\r\n\r\n$> cd attention \r\n\r\n$> datalad metadata\r\n[WARNING] Metadata query results might be incomplete, initial metadata aggregation was not yet performed in 1 dataset at: ['/tmp/attention'] \r\nTotal (44 ok, 24 failed out of 231):   4%|\u2589                      | 191M/4.45G [00:29<10:35, 6.71MB/s]00<?, ?B/s]\r\nsub-rid000001/func/sub-rid0 .. _task-beh_run-1_bold.nii.gz:  44%|\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u258d     | 16.0M/36.5M [00:16<00:18, 1.08MB/s]\r\nsub-rid000001/func/sub-rid0 .. _task-beh_run-2_bold.nii.gz:  45%|\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u258c     | 16.4M/36.5M [00:16<00:17, 1.12MB/s]\r\nsub-rid000001/func/sub-rid0 .. _task-beh_run-4_bold.nii.gz:  70%|\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588   | 25.4M/36.0M [00:13<00:05, 2.08MB/s]\r\nsub-rid000001/func/sub-rid0 .. _task-beh_run-5_bold.nii.gz:  17%|\u2588\u258b        | 6.32M/36.4M [00:03<00:14, 2.04MB/s\r\n```\r\nI think such automagic data retrieval should not happen in such a case. I would even say that metadata should not be automagically aggregated if I merely ask for already known (if any) metadata.\r\n\r\n#### What version of DataLad are you using (run `datalad --version`)? On what operating system (consider running `datalad wtf`)?\r\n\r\nCurrent master, to become a 0.10, 0.9.3-1122-g3263da67\r\n#### Is there anything else that would be useful to know in this context?\r\n#### Have you had any success using DataLad before?
