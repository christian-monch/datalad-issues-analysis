Relevant bits from the docs:\r\n\r\n- does not require any cleanup\r\n- lock gets dropped automatically if the process crashes, even if\r\n  `__exit__` is not executed\r\n\r\nLocking behavior is logged at level 5 and looks like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[Level 5] Acquired file lock `b'/tmp/datalad_temp_test_obtaink1uf9sf9/.git/config_dataladlock'` after waiting 0.000s [1 attempts were required]\r\n[Level 5] Unlocked and closed file lock open on `b'/tmp/datalad_temp_test_obtaink1uf9sf9/.git/config_dataladlock'`\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `fasteners` package is already a direct dependency. It seems to\r\nprovide the standard solution for this problem.\r\n\r\nDoing locking only at config-write, instead of more global \"dataset is\r\nin use\"-locks has the advantage of minimizing bottlenecks with external\r\nparallelization approaches (i.e. via `xargs -P`). However, it is\r\nobviously not sufficient in general.\r\n\r\nOne could debate whether the lock should also cover read operations to\r\navoid missing partial update done by process A when process B is\r\nreloading a dataset configuration.\r\n\r\nRelated : #1455\r\n\r\nUpdate: This PR now also fixes #4809 ", "closed_by": {"login": "mih", "id": 136479, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjQ3OQ==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/136479?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih", "html_url": "https://github.com/mih", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/4808/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/4808/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
