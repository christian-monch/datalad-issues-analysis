As a workaround I could add 'git annex init' call to `update --merge` invocation, which should then re-enable all those remotes, but ideally I think there could be a logic during `git annex merge`, tracking what additional remotes were added  and autoenabling those which have autoenable=True.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/1093/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/1093/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
