As discussed in https://github.com/miykael/nipype_tutorial/issues/79, we have problem to download the `workshops/nih-2017/ds000114` deriviatves, from inside the docker image. Outside, it doesn't create any problem.\r\n\r\nI've set up a docker image `miykael/datalad_test`, with which you can recreate the issue. It installed `datalad_neuroimaging` via `pip` and installed the openfmri dataset with `datalad install -r ///workshops/nih-2017/ds000114`. Some more information:\r\n```\r\ngit-annex version: 6.20180416+gitg86b18966f-1~ndall+1\r\ndatalad 0.10.0.rc1\r\n```\r\n\r\n So, to open the docker image to recreate the issue, just use\r\n\r\n```\r\ndocker run -it --rm miykael/datalad_test\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd once inside, try:\r\n```\r\ndatalad get ds000114/derivatives/fmriprep/sub-01.html\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich will give you the error:\r\n```\r\n[ERROR  ] from web...                                                                                 \r\n| from web...\r\n| Unable to access these remotes: web\r\n| Try making some of these repositories available:\r\n| \t0000...0001 -- web\r\n|  \tb8b7...8eb9 -- yoh@smaug:/mnt/btrfs/datasets/datalad/crawl/workshops/nih-workshop-2017/ds000114/derivatives/fmriprep\r\n|  [get(/home/neuro/ds000114/derivatives/fmriprep/sub-01.html)] \r\nget(error): /home/neuro/ds000114/derivatives/fmriprep/sub-01.html (file) [from web...\r\nfrom web...\r\nUnable to access these remotes: web\r\nTry making some of these repositories available:\r\n\t0000...0001 -- web\r\n \tb8b7...8eb9 -- yoh@smaug:/mnt/btrfs/datasets/datalad/crawl/workshops/nih-workshop-2017/ds000114/derivatives/fmriprep\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm sorry to annoy you with this issue, but I'm really stuck with the problem and don't see how to solve it.", "closed_by": {"login": "miykael", "id": 950321, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjk1MDMyMQ==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/950321?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/miykael", "html_url": "https://github.com/miykael", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/miykael/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/miykael/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/miykael/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/miykael/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/miykael/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/miykael/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/miykael/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/miykael/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/miykael/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/2472/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/2472/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
