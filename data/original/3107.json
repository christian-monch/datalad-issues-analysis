The idea is to not have an automated mechanism report random blobs, but have a clear and tailored mapping in a dataset's configuration that defines which native metadata field to use to populate a specific field in the standard set.\r\n\r\nMy idea of a minimal set was written down (a long time ago) here:\r\nhttp://docs.datalad.org/en/latest/metadata.html#rfc822-compliant-metadata-datalad-rfc822\r\n\r\nToday I would probably add some kind of \"tag\" list.\r\n\r\nI personally see the target audience to be humans (pretty much a necessity, when no defined terms for the metadata values (not keys) are used).\r\n\r\nMoreover, I see this as an entirely optional feature. It won't solve the data discovery problem to any reasonable extent, but I acknowledge that I can hide the severity of the problem to some degree.\r\n\r\nPlease comment on the particular selection of metadata fields for this minimal set. Please also comment on the desired structure of the values. I personally think that anything beyond free-form text is useless, as it won't be significantly more useful (compared to actual linked data), but substantially increases the burden on users of this functionality. Hence I'd put \"must be a human-readable string\" a instructions.\r\n\r\nPS: I should clarify that such a mapping from native to common fields would be defined in the dataset that is being aggregated _into_ to avoid the need to modified subdatasets for this purpose (and for a particular purpose that may or may not be what the \"main\" function of any dataset is envisioned to be).", "closed_by": {"login": "mih", "id": 136479, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjQ3OQ==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/136479?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih", "html_url": "https://github.com/mih", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/3107/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/3107/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
