On what operating system (consider running `datalad wtf`)?\r\n\r\nCurrently I am using DataLad version 0.12.6, and git-annex version 8.20200330. I have tried a number of different versions of DataLad (including 0.13.0rc2) and git-annex, and they resulted in the same error. The server is CentOS 7.7.1908.\r\n\r\n#### Is there anything else that would be useful to know in this context?\r\n\r\n`git annex whereis preventad_1004359_PREBL00_bold_001.mnc`\r\nRunning 'git-annex whereis' and 'git-annex get' on the file there is no output (even using verbose mode). It's as if I'd hit enter on the terminal without writing any commands. Running either of these commands on debug mode prints various \"process done ExitSuccess\" and no errors.\r\n\r\nI have also tried installing the dataset in a different directory to no avail.\r\n\r\n#### Have you had any success using DataLad before? (to assess your expertise/prior luck.  We would welcome your testimonial additions to https://github.com/datalad/datalad/wiki/Testimonials as well)\r\nI have had success getting the other CONP datasets on the server, and getting the files in question locally.\r\n\r\nThank you very much for your help!
