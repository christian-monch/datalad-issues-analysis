Current implementation of\r\nGitTransportRI simply splits apart transport and underlying RI attributes.\r\nSince directed toward maint I have refrained from doing any code refactoring, such as\r\nin RI().__init__ and in the tests check() to avoid using \"ri\" (and other) arguments\r\nwhich might collide with fields provided in **kwargs.  May be in some next sweep\r\nthose all could become prefixed (or suffixed) with  _ to avoid such collisions.\r\n\r\nWe could also make this GitTransportRI immediately turn underlying RI into an\r\ninstance (ATM it is just a string), and also expose .path as all other RIs\r\napparently do.  But again, for the sake of the quick fix for now to not cause\r\nhard to decypher errors, I decided to postpone that.\r\n\r\nNote: I have not attempted to actually use it in some sample case fully since\r\ne.g. our create-sibling-github has no clue about transport::, would need to\r\noverride url it provides for the remote and may be more...\r\n\r\nCloses #4489 ", "closed_by": {"login": "kyleam", "id": 1297788, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTc3ODg=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1297788?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam", "html_url": "https://github.com/kyleam", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/4529/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/4529/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
