But I frequently miss ability to do diff of the content.  If, for starters, it could do it for at least text files (according to mime) -- that would already be super useful.\r\n\r\nI have played with diff drivers for git/annex while comparing results on AFNI test battery run -- it is \"cumbersome\" to say the least.
