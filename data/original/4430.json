However, instead of lumping things together and having git-annex sort things out, this is a more targeted attempt at picking individual files, looking for their availability info, and transfer/enable necessary special remote configuration.\r\n\r\nThis can only be considered a first step. Many (speed) optimizations are possible, various features could be added (e.g. arbitrary special remote support, for now only `datalad` remote). However, it is reasonably complete and functional to a degree that it is capable of filtering a dataset like https://github.com/datalad-datasets/human-connectome-project-openaccess\r\n\r\n\r\n##### Acknowledgements\r\nThis work was, in part, supported by the European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme under Grant Agreement no. 785907 (HBP SGA2).", "closed_by": {"login": "mih", "id": 136479, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjQ3OQ==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/136479?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih", "html_url": "https://github.com/mih", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/4430/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/4430/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
