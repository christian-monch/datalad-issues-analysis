Pretty much nothing announces the death of a clone. In a paradigm where we have a \"central\" clone on which `create-sibling-*` commands operate, but where we require users to individually remove such siblings using unspecified platform-specific means (delete repo on (github|osf|..), log into a machine and run `remove` in a shell, etc.) this is hard to implement.\r\n\r\nWhat about changing the paradigm to also perform sibling removal from a \"central\" management clone?\r\n\r\n* and by central I obviously do not mean any significant centralization, but rather a more persistent clone that knows about all relevant siblings.\r\n\r\nIn such a paradigm, we would also have a series of `remove-sibling-*` commands to parallel their `create-sibling-*` companions. Or we become fancy and learn the ability to have subcommands for `create` and `remove` actions of a `sibling-<type>` proxy command series.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/5946/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/5946/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
