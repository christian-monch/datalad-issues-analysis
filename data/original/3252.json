It will keep use of those commands in their own tests, of course.\r\n\r\nLet's see where we stand.\r\n\r\n- [x] replace standard `add` calls with `rev_save()`\r\n- [x] deal with the tests that do `add(save=False)` -- must use repo method now.\r\n- [x] replace (now often pointless) calls to `save()` with either nothing or `rev_save()` too\r\n- [x] RF `make_demo_hierarchy_datasets()` helper to make a properly linked dataset hierarchy, not a pile of datasets\r\n- [x] RF tests that assumed a `create()` can simply turn a git repo into an annex repo\r\n- [x] RF tests that relied on the fact that a single `create()` yields more than one commit in a dataset, whereas `rev_create()` just yield one.\r\n- [x] BF `rev_create` to prevent spurious dataset ID change on force-recreate\r\n- check which additional tests can be exercised on appveyor after the RF -- this is left for a dedicated exploration of the big picture at a later date\r\n\r\n#### Protocol of functionality that relies on features of `create()` that are not supported by `rev_create()`:\r\n- `addurls` offer a global `save` switch that causes any dataset modification to not be saved. This includes the initial dataset content placed in by `create` as well. I don't see why this would be needed, and it is off by default already.\r\n\r\n#### Performance anecdote:\r\n\r\nPicking what I believe is our most organic test scenario, although it is mostly cloning...\r\n\r\non current master\r\n```\r\n% timeit make_studyforrest_mockup('/tmp/mockup_'+str(uuid.uuid1()))\r\n1 loop, best of 3: 35.7 s per loop\r\n```\r\n\r\nthis PR\r\n```\r\n% timeit make_studyforrest_mockup('/tmp/mockup_'+str(uuid.uuid1()))\r\n1 loop, best of 3: 30.4 s per loop\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n", "closed_by": {"login": "yarikoptic", "id": 39889, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjM5ODg5", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39889?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic", "html_url": "https://github.com/yarikoptic", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/3252/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/3252/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
