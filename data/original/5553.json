all of them to come before we report that many identical were received\r\n- screen gets flooded with all those `INFO` messages on scanning the unlocked files\r\n\r\nI do not have clear ideas yet on how we should approach (besides somehow suppressing identical log messages)  and/or implement (besides -- the first one about overall progress loss seems like a separate issue, may be related to recent refactoring of progress bar id, may be it morphs into a new one when total gets adjusted or smth like that)", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url":
