However, the situation changed quite a bit since the last attempt. We are already making multiple calls to `git commit` in `GitRepo.commit()` and a simplistic approach would be to add another `git commit --amend` with a `NoCapture` protocol execution to enable interactive specification of a commit message, if so desired (i.e. configured). The approach could be similar/identifical to #4121, but there would be a `StdOutErrCapture` execution first (which is the status quo) in order to maintain the error/behavior detection we have in place, and one additional invocation of `git commit` at the end. Performance is a non-issue for interactive message edits anyways.\r\n\r\nI added a test to #4996 to verify that interactive execution is viable via `WitlessRunner` (https://github.com/datalad/datalad/pull/4996/commits/17339db0d5b9bcaebe56d1584479dc065880d366)", "closed_by": {"login": "mih", "id": 136479, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjQ3OQ==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/136479?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih", "html_url": "https://github.com/mih", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/5004/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/5004/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
