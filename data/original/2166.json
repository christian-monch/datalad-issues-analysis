So I wondered if nifti1 could/should be generalized into a more generic `neuroimaging_files`  or alike, which would provide extractors for other relevant datatypes ('.mgz', '.HEAD/.BRIK', etc) some of which are already supported by nibabel -- so it might be just a matter of a few additional dictionaries to define term mappins.\r\n\r\nWe could actually may be make 'meta-extractors' which provide such aggregation of different domain-specific ones.   I would just hate to go through each dataset and see which file types are in there... with every crawl/commit.  So I could just specify a set of domains for which to enable extractors for, in case they find some relevant file.", "closed_by": {"login": "yarikoptic", "id": 39889, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjM5ODg5", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39889?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic", "html_url": "https://github.com/yarikoptic", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/2166/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/2166/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
