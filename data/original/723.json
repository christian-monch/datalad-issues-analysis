I was aiming to fix more of install logic (check for submodules should happen even for annex repos etc), but then also got hurt by remaining \"creativism\" of install uses in test_install and non-uniform handling of paths to datasets if they contain symlinks (I have TMPDIR=$HOME/.tmp  which is a symlink to /tmp, to reveal all kinds of gory failures).  So let's see first how these fixes hold, and they might resolve issues for @debanjum trying to 'install -r datasets ///' (another culprit found was using proxy -- don't use it for this call).  I will try to get a fresher look into it tomorrow as well\n\nShould at least partially address https://github.com/datalad/datalad/issues/693\n", "closed_by": {"login": "mih", "id": 136479, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjQ3OQ==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/136479?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih", "html_url": "https://github.com/mih", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/723/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/723/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
