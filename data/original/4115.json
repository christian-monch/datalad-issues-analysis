I would suggest the default value of `--if-dirty` is switched to fail, this way the user by default is faced with the problem rather than the software making the decision. It would then make sense that a user faced with the problem selects either `--if-dirty save` or `--if-dirty ignore` to proceed. I know changes in default values are not easy decisions, but the defaults usually should (1) make selections for naive users which all of us are at the beginning, and (2) follow the most common use (which does not seem the right thing to do for most users; trigger saving all pending changes when removing a single file). Just a thought/suggestion. \r\n\r\n\r\n#### What steps will reproduce the problem?\r\nNA\r\n\r\n#### What version of DataLad are you using (run `datalad --version`)? On what operating system (consider running `datalad wtf`)?\r\n0.12.2 (github today)\r\n\r\n#### Is there anything else that would be useful to know in this context?\r\nNope.\r\n\r\n#### Have you had any success using DataLad before? (to assess your expertise/prior luck.  We would welcome your testimonial additions to https://github.com/datalad/datalad/wiki/Testimonials as well)\r\nSure, love is in the air :)", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/4115/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/4115/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
