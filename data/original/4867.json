In the \"batch\" it seems to be only 20k files, and actual adding urls completed quite fast.  Now I had been staring at slowly growing `Adding metadata (10240 skipped):...` so majority were skipped but not due to \"no metadata\" I think but because `.add` was not needed would be my guess (`with_result_progress` maps \"notneeded\" into \"skipped\" and does nohow filters by record).\r\n\r\nPR is now a collection of small changes intended to optimize (although didn't test yet either there is a real advantage) `addurls` while running on large(r) number of files and not bothering to add metadata.\r\n\r\nOne change in behavior would be that I removed `repo.add` which now was ran for every file and then message was perculated up and then at the end in a typical use case `ds.save` would have been called on those files again.  Now, if `save=False`, then those files would remain \"annexed\" (converted to symlinks) but not added to git repository.  IMHO that is Ok since \"staging does no longer exists\" in datalad world, and `save=False` was IIRC introduced to facilitate use with `datalad run` which would call `save` anyways.\r\n\r\nLet me know what you think, and I will probably test next batch of running addurls on this version to see if it feels any better.", "closed_by": {"login": "mih", "id": 136479, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjQ3OQ==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/136479?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih", "html_url": "https://github.com/mih", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/4867/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/4867/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
