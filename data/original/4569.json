And the target use cases were quite sparse.  While scrolling a lengthy `diff` output where I wanted to check what changes have happened since previous publish of `///`, use case came up, which would have been especially nice in conjunction with some `diff --stat` or alike: to limit diff to the specified depth.  For me to get an overview of changes, I think something like `datalad diff --recursion-limit 2` should be sufficient.  If I could have per each hit there get a stat as well (especially if that entry is a subsuperdataset) on +-~datasets, +-~files (where + - added, - - removed, and ~ - changed)    , would have been useful and I think --recursion-limit could be of use there.\r\nBut altogether it is not really a \"huge\" usecase to just decide to keep --recursion-limit for ;)  Just wanted to share, feel free to close", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/4569/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/4569/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
