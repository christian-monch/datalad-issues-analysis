And I also see no need to do so either.\r\n\r\nThere are many non-exclusive paths to go from the status quo\r\n\r\n- implement a new command (pair?) for data distribution handling in an extension, which would essentially exhibit the behavior of 0.11 `install/get`, maybe even prior to 0.11\r\n\r\n- replace `install` in the handbook with `clone`. This is largely a rename, nothing in the book uses any features of `install` that `clone` doesn't provide. Also some explanations become unecessary, because the `source` option is no longer a special thing.\r\n\r\n- Rename 0.12 `get` to something else, and maintain the old `get` as-is (and with it `install`). This also requires a rename in the handbook, as the path semantics would no longer match.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/3922/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 1}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/3922/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
