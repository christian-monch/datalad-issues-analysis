The datasets tend to be static, i.e. few versions per file (if any).\r\n\r\ngit-annex operations are essentially per file, and the smaller the files the more impact per-file overhead gets. That overhead is not necessarily caused by datalad or git-annex but is essentially inherent in the nature of things (e.g. one HTTP request per file).\r\n\r\nI think it would be beneficial for such cases, to have a method that can \"give me the entire thing\" or at least \"give me the entire annex\" of a particular remote. In some case it will be possible to implement much faster ways to obtain the content, by e.g. streaming a large file based on a single request. I suspect that cloud-storage applications would also benefit from few requests to big files, rather then many small ones (speedwise alone, not even talking about API usage constraints).", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/4677/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/4677/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
