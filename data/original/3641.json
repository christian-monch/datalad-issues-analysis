Problem related to https://git-annex.branchable.com/forum/not_finding_git-annex-shell_on_remote/\r\n\r\nWorkaround could be to define `remote.<name>.annex-shell` locally, as a config setting for an `install` command -- but it doesn't work.\r\n\r\nBecause the `enableremote` fails, the remote is set to `annex-ignore`. Once `annex-shell` is configured *afterwards*, and `annex-ignore` is removed manually, things start working.\r\n\r\nSo custom annex installs are possible, but are needlessly hard to configure. We could add some kind of convenience mechanism that fixes the config up as necessary.\r\n\r\nPing @dickscheid", "closed_by": {"login": "mih", "id": 136479, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjQ3OQ==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/136479?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih", "html_url": "https://github.com/mih", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/3641/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/3641/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
