On a machine with lots of users that pull lots of files that can quickly grow into a number of connections that trigger firewall rules on the remote end that lead to seemingly broken network connections for any user on such a box.\r\n\r\nQ1: git-annex does serial by default and is no problem, we do parallel but go through a control master. Did anyone look into how this would look like from a server perspective? One connection, multiple serverside ssh-processes?\r\nQ 2: can we centrally reconfigure this behavior to go serial by default, in order to avoid having to instruct each user to use (and obey)  `get -J 1`, if that would be needed? I.o.w. can an admin somehow intervene without having to edit the sources?\r\n\r\nSomewhat related to this: https://github.com/datalad/datalad/issues/3583", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/3615/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/3615/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
