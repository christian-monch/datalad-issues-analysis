It would also be inconsistent\r\nwith a single `-m` we provide for recursive `save` operation. With all the recursion\r\nwe better provide our own statistics and information about what is about\r\nto happen.  In this initial commit I am not harvesting those stats, since\r\nit would require further code RFing, and possibly some side-effect OPT to not\r\nbother collecting and/or carrying around all the \"clean\" state information\r\nabout all the files in all datasets (but on a quick attempt it caused some tests expecting 'ok'\r\nfor even clean subdatasets)\r\n\r\nTo invoke editor upon save, just specify -m .  In the long run, we could\r\nmake it behave like git, i.e. upon not only an explicitly empty, but `None`\r\nas well.\r\n\r\nFor now I have used `subprocess.call` directly without bothering with `Runner` to not inherit any possible complications. Moreover, interface to edit a file should be provided by UIs, so then some gui/web ui had a chance to provide needed interface.", "closed_by": {"login": "mih", "id": 136479, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjQ3OQ==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/136479?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih", "html_url": "https://github.com/mih", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/3893/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/3893/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
