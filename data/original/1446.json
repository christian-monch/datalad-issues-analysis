So far it seems to be not possible (see edit 1 below)\r\n- for final \"publish\" command:\r\n  - [ ] should add regular (`web` remote) urls for each file, since published version could have access to them\r\n  - [ ] we might want to upload also the git repository itself as a tarball. Then we could easily implement (one time) \"datalad clone\" from it, which would fetch/extract that tarball and then be able to fetch the files as usual\r\n- [ ] atm we (ab)use 'STATE' which annex allows to associate with key/remote, to store the file id as zenodo knows it, but may be we would be better off by providing `datalad-zenodo` urls, similar to datalad-archives url for that purpose. not sure yet\r\n- [x] fixes #23\r\n\r\nedit 1: I thought that zenodo can provide files from subdirs, but apparently that was incorrect perception -- what I thought was subdirs, was listing of the content of .zip file (e.g. for github projects).  Still waiting on a possible reply from zenodo folks about this feature. If there is no way, the closest solution could be to upload with some file for that key original name + some additional suffix corresponding to beginningof the key checksum to disambiguate possible collisions.  E.g. instead of `MD5E-s10025785--0e790e210a275d76e3f2f4d895df6358.nii.gz` it would become `sub-02_T1w_0e790e21.nii.gz`.  I don't think it would be likely to get a collision but we could add some additional sanity check (at a cost of even slower interactions)", "closed_by": {"login": "yarikoptic", "id": 39889, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjM5ODg5", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39889?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic", "html_url": "https://github.com/yarikoptic", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/1446/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/1446/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
