Currently each subject folder (sub-*) is a separate subdataset, but I would like to take this one step further. I would like to create additional subdatasets underneath each subject subdataset corresponding to the session folder (ses-*). Once I try this, however, I get the error `[ERROR  ] collision with content in parent dataset`. What I would ultimately like to do is to retain the subject subdataset, but additionally create a session subdataset based on the subject superdataset. \r\n#### What steps will reproduce the problem?\r\nmkdir -p superdataset/subdataset\r\necho hello world >> superdataset/subdataset/hello_world.txt\r\ndatalad create --force -d superdataset \r\ndatalad save superdataset\r\ncd superdataset/\r\ndatalad create --force -d subdataset\r\n#### What version of DataLad are you using (run `datalad --version`)? On what operating system (consider running `datalad wtf`)?\r\nversion: 0.14.6+60.g3cddd7c4a\r\nOS: centos/7/Core\r\n#### Is there anything else that would be useful to know in this context?\r\nMaybe this is a simple thing to do, I just could not find anything within the datalad handbook nor within the github issues. I'm not sure if this changes anything, but all of the subject folders are backed up to S3 using `git annex initremote`.\r\n", "closed_by": {"login": "yarikoptic", "id": 39889, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjM5ODg5", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39889?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic", "html_url": "https://github.com/yarikoptic", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/6021/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/6021/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
