With datalad we quite often commit recursively, and thus  we have no way ATM to revert recursively.  Possible gotcha/complications:\r\n- it would be impossible to cleanly revert in the superdataset,\r\n- in submodule commit difference might correspond to more than a single commit (Then I guess optionally we could try to revert full sequence of them)", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/2783/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/2783/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
