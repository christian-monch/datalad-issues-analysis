All it can to is nothing (`skip`), or call `create_sibling` (`inherit`). It fails for any other kind of remote, and of course cannot do anything if a superdataset has nothing in common with a subdataset in terms of  remotes.\r\n\r\nThat all comes at the price of an API argument slot, and a TODO list that nobody has tackled: #1344, #1491, #1673 in two years.\r\n\r\nI am not convinced that mixing tasks (push content vs. create publication targets) is anyhow superior to a dedicated command whose purpose is to create publication targets for datasets that don't have one. It certainly runs counter to my desire to come up with a reasonably minimal core API.\r\n\r\nAnother aspect is the implied dependency of `publish` on `create_sibling`. Taking one step back, I'd  consider `create_sibling` as more of a leaf command, as there are plenty of publications targets that have nothing to do with this functionality (all kinds of web/storage services) and even within the Git world (GitHub, GitLab) `create_sibling` is pretty much irrelevant.\r\n\r\nTaken all together, I think we should not fold `create_sibling` functionality into `publish`.", "closed_by": {"login": "mih", "id": 136479, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjQ3OQ==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/136479?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih", "html_url": "https://github.com/mih", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/3419/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/3419/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
