That forces a user to decide on `rerun` whether or not to use `--explicit` (and its docstring rightfully suggests to be careful with that).\r\n\r\nHowever, besides running on a dirty dataset, the `--explicit` flag is instrumental in saving only select outputs. In that case, running `rerun` without explicit will lead to different results, even if all outcomes are bit-identical. Rerun only allows to put an an entire rerun run ;-) into explicit mode, but in practice the explicitness can vary from record to record.\r\n\r\nMaybe\r\n\r\n1. starting on a dirty dataset\r\n2. only saving explicitly listed outputs\r\n\r\nare two different things that should not be triggered together with a single option.
