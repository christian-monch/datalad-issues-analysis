The data will be available for download in some way. We should have a helper that can alter an existing handle to register a newly available data source. Git annex can do this in a number of ways (e.g. special remotes). We should add a helper on top of this that can do things like:\n- [ ] Register a new URL for all files given a single base URL (and a simple templating/regex thingy that can construct the full per-file URL from the handle content: relative path, some hash, ...)\n- [ ] A way to register that a particular state of a handle (just the content) is available in a tarball accessible from a URL\n- [ ] Create some kind of \"dual configuration\" special remote. For example, I want to publish a handle to Github, while the files have to go elsewhere. I could use an rsync special remote to push them to a server, but I likely need a different configuration for public access (push via ssh, download via rsync daemon)\n", "closed_by": {"login": "mih", "id": 136479, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjQ3OQ==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/136479?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih", "html_url": "https://github.com/mih", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/331/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/331/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
