See [this description](https://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/issues/2059) to get an overview of an \"ideal flow.\" I am thinking that DataLad could be a really good solution to handle the versioning and general interaction of a dataset! I'm wondering, how is the community creating definitions for organization, and then having datalad be able to plug into them? (You can talk about BIDS as an example!) We would want to be able to have a set of organizational templates that define formats and file structure/organization, and then plug that into use via datalad across Google Cloud storage, compute locations, and then archive. Your wisdom / thoughts / all of the above would be greatly appreciated - very excited to chat about this!\r\n\r\n@cmh2166 @hannahfrost @rmarinshaw", "closed_by": {"login": "mih", "id": 136479, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjQ3OQ==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/136479?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih", "html_url": "https://github.com/mih", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/2814/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/2814/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
