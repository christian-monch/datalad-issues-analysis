However, other sources can have similar needs and presently have no chance to be supported. One example is OSF https://github.com/datalad/datalad-osf/pull/106 which can represent an entire dataset in an OSF project. It provides a git-remote-helper to support cloning from such a non-standard source. However, datalad does not support connecting a potentially existing `osf-storage` annex remote as a publication dependency (and similar tuning to was RIA does and needs).\r\n\r\nI see two ways forward:\r\n\r\n1. RF the present RIA code to provide a mechanism to hook into this procedure\r\n2. Use the result hooks to listen to a successful clone event\r\n3.
