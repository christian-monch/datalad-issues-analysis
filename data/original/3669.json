But our commands can fail leaving repository in a not clean state. E.g. in our with @dnkennedy exploration of `datalad run` output was unlocked, but then command failed, and we were left with unlocked files on the drive preventing us to do any other `run`.  Resetting state to the prior clean state is the reasonable way to deal with such issues in a general systematic way.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/3669/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/3669/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
