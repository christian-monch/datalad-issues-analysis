May be eventually it could even become common (there is no reason for `get` to not support `auto*` modes) and listed among common options of the [cheat sheet](http://handbook.datalad.org/en/latest/basics/101-136-cheatsheet.html).\r\n\r\n- Candidates such as `-D`, `-d` are already taken.\r\n- `-t` is also used in a wide variety of contexts without any consistency.\r\n- The only one relating to \"transfer\" left seems to be `-T` but I think it is more about \"data\" than \"transfer\" so I do not like it either.\r\n\r\nAltogether - I do not see any short option :-/\r\n\r\n## `--data`\r\n\r\nOrthogonal alternative compromise is to introduce `--data` instead of `--transfer-data` in #4620 , which would at least be shorter and easier to remember, e.g. `datalad push --data anything --to myremote`.\r\n  \r\nWhile at it also deprecate `--transfer-data` in `publish` (in favor of `--data`) if that one to survive.  That would also \"assist\" with conscious migration from `publish --transfer-data all` to `publish --data anything`.\r\n\r\nLater we could RF/enhance `get` to make it default to `get --data=auto-if-wanted` and use `get --data=nothing` instead(?) of `get -n`, making interfaces more consistent.", "closed_by": {"login": "kyleam", "id": 1297788, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTc3ODg=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1297788?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam", "html_url": "https://github.com/kyleam", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/4622/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/4622/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
