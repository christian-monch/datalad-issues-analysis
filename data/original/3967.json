This is a parent dataset named \"freesurfer \" which contains ~440 sudatasets named \"sub-*\". Total size about 1.3Tb, with 1.3+ million files overall, spread of course in the subdatasets.\r\nWe work in a collabroative environment with one master location and collaborators cloning and making changes. When things are ready from a collaborator, I pull the changes in the master location following two steps:\r\n1. Add the location of the collaborator as sibling (with `--recursive` to add respective siblings to subdatasets).\r\n2. Run `datalad update --recursive --sibling mandy --merge`.\r\nThe merge seems to go quickly for about 10 minutes where I can see messages showing fetching and applying for each subdataset. Then the process does something after the last `update(ok)` which takes a couple of hours before stating `action summary` and returning the prompt.\r\n```console\r\n[INFO   ] Applying updates to <Dataset path=/DATA/FEDERATED_DATASETS/STUDY1/data/processed/freesurfer/sub-T99599>\r\nupdate(ok): sub-T99599 (dataset)\r\naction summary:\r\n  save (notneeded: 1)\r\n  update (ok: 442)\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### What steps will reproduce the problem?\r\nCan't share this huge dataset, but if you have some datasets this big, you could try to reproduce it.\r\n\r\n#### What version of DataLad are you using (run `datalad --version`)? On what operating system (consider running `datalad wtf`)?\r\n0.12.0rc6 (installed from github some days ago)\r\n\r\n#### Is there anything else that would be useful to know in this context?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n#### Have you had any success using DataLad before? (to assess your expertise/prior luck.  We would welcome your testimonial additions to https://github.com/datalad/datalad/wiki/Testimonials as well)\r\nDatalad is the future of data organization :)\r\n", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/3967/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/3967/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
