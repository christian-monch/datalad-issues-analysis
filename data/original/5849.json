I have a folder where each subject is a dataset (files added from s3 via addurls). I've realized these should not be subdatasets because each only contains 30-50 files and it should be one dataset with subfolders not subdatasets...\r\n\r\n1) is there an easy way to convert this folder of subdatasets into one large dataset with subfolders(not subdatasets) for each subject, and all files still maintaining their provenance so that they can be dropped and redownloaded from s3 as needed. When there was a superdataset of these subdatasets, operations were prohibitively slow.\r\n\r\nIf it is easier, on our server, someone has already downloaded the entire HBN data and it is in BIDS format. \r\n\r\n2) is there an easy way to make this existing folder a datalad dataset, and adding the s3 source of each existing file and making datalad trust that is the source. Some files have been renamed by necessity.\r\n\r\n3) are either of those above options too complicated - ideally, we wouldn't want to redownload all of the data but maybe that is the most feasible option. Haven't been able to figure out the best way to do this, any input on this problem appreciated - thanks!", "closed_by": {"login": "yarikoptic", "id": 39889, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjM5ODg5", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39889?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic", "html_url": "https://github.com/yarikoptic", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/5849/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/5849/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
