Therefore, it would be great if datalad datasets could be published to gin (including annex'ed data) and somewhere else like github (sans annex'ed data) such that if the dataset is `datalad clone`d from the github repo, the gin sibling is automatically configured and data can be automatically fetched using `datalad get`.\r\n\r\n#### Is there anything else that would be useful to know in this context?\r\n\r\nSpecifically, I tried this here: https://gin.g-node.org/mikapfl/read_di_unfccc/ and here: https://github.com/mikapfl/read_di_unfccc ; I ended up doing the \"coupling\" with a README for now.\r\n", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/5094/reactions", "total_count": 2, "+1": 2, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/5094/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
