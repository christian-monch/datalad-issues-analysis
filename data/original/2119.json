Ideally I guess all that code should become a generator, but not sure how feasible it is anyways since stderr isn't necessarily \"coupled\" with stdin so we wouldn't be able to generally assign specifically stderr to particular files.  Hence: http://git-annex.branchable.com/todo/include_msg_with_possible_reason_why_command___40__e.g._add__41___failed_into_--json_output/\r\n- [x] more tests revealed an issue on OSX on not having processed lines which are still available upon process completes (.poll returns None).  So it demanded heavy code refactoring.  I am not sure if it became anyhow easier to follow but at least it became a bit more modular.  Also removed some conditions checking since seems to work without ;-)  \r\n\r\noverall -- it came out much larger than what I hoped/expected/initially did.  But hopefully would be resilient enough to not introduce regressions\r\n\r\nThis might result in negative impact on performance while calling those batch commands (since would require creation of a file) but imho better slower but more reliable ;)\r\n\r\nUnless immediate objections, I would like to merge it asap.  We could fix up/refactor later if needed, but \"stuck\" operation of datalad without any error msg isn't fun\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n- [x] This change is complete\r\n\r\nPlease have a look @datalad/developers\r\n", "closed_by": {"login": "yarikoptic", "id": 39889, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjM5ODg5", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39889?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic", "html_url": "https://github.com/yarikoptic", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/2119/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/2119/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
