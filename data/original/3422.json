(could be exposed as `DATALAD_RUN_EXPLICIT`)\r\n- in case of `--explicit` I felt I could benefit from knowin inputs/outputs.  Probably the best approach could be to store the entire `run` record in some temp file which would then be exposed via e.g. `DATALAD_RUN_RECORDFILE` variable\r\n\r\nand then I wanted even ability to be able to alter the run record:\r\n- shim might decide to alter run details, e.g. specify additional output files.  One way is to alter the run record file (above)\r\n\r\nI guess the issue might get populated more later...", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/3422/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/3422/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
