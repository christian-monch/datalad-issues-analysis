Such double-entry is typically done on entry/when defining new passwords.  I think we should allow entry once, and if entered incorrectly, authentication would fail. and we should offer to reenter.  And I believe that is how it behaved before and would be after\r\n#2708 \r\nThoughts @mih since you are the one who introduced it -- what was your use case which shown the need in this verification?\r\n\r\nPS that code will be RFed slightly in the upcoming PR but I will retain the double entry as a default for now", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/2721/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/2721/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
