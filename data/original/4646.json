Had to try this a few times because some subdatasets weren't in the remote initially. Now the local and remote seem to be in sync when I check git log, but the publish call ends with this error:\r\n```\r\n[ERROR  ] failed to push to pushsibling: master -> pushsibling/master [rejected] (non-fast-forward); pushed: ['[up to date]'] [publish(/home/dp/datasets/apr26/freesurfer)]\r\npublish(error): .

On what operating system (consider running `datalad wtf`)?\r\n0.12.6\r\n\r\n#### Is there anything else that would be useful to know in this context?\r\nNA\r\n\r\n#### Have you had any success using DataLad before?
