My utopian idea was to just make everything self-contained within conda distribution but I think it would not provide full solution anyways due to intricacy which entering MSYS2 bash entails (filters PATH, changes HOME, etc).  So I think it might benefit if we establish (and ensure by crashing if not so) for now the one and only way `datalad` runtime is used on windows -- in \"git bash\", so no Windows `$HOME` is expected to be consulted etc, git bundled tools come from git distribution (not e.g. from `m2-bash` under conda).\r\n\r\nWe can identify that we are running within \"git bash\" by inspecting `MSYSTEM` env var to be \"MINGW64\", and `SSH_ASKPASS` be `/mingw64/libexec/git-core/git-gui--askpass`.  `which git` should resolve to `/mingw64/bin/git`.  If not -- kaboom and tell people to run within \"git bash\" terminal.\r\n\r\nedit 1: if we see that `bash` is coming from WSL (and somehow not `/usr/bin/bash`), the battle @adswa was fighting?, we also just fail for starters.\r\n\r\nWe would need to check what is that `bash` environment used in [github actions](https://github.com/datalad/git-annex/blob/master/.github/workflows/build-windows.yaml) on windows, and if \"suitable\", retire appveyor setup which I believe runs \"windows natively\"\r\n\r\nlater we could explore crazy idea to support \"native\" windows execution: If `datalad` is executed within a regular Windows command line, (no `MSYSTEM`) -- we can locate `git`, and see if it has `bash` and re-spawn the process as `C:\\Program Files\\Git\\bin\\bash -c datalad \"$@\"` of a kind (with any necessary MSYS2 env var flags and possibly as login shell) thus ensuring that whatever `sh` or any command would be ran in a consistent \"git bash\" environment.", "closed_by": {"login": "yarikoptic", "id": 39889, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjM5ODg5", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39889?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic", "html_url": "https://github.com/yarikoptic", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/5149/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/5149/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
