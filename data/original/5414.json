We just realized that our approach to remove images that failed QC is not a good strategy. So, we are not integrating the bad data anyway and marking them with BAD\\* prefix. Someone on neurostars gave us the interesting idea of [keeping different datalad branches](https://neurostars.org/t/adding-failed-qc-scans-to-bids-dataset/18103/8) for data with or without bad data. This can be a good solution, but we have not used branches before in datalad. There does not seem to be a lot in docs and the book either. My original idea was simply to tag the current version of good data and then add/commit the new bad data. This way I can go back in time to having just the good data. But this approach is probably not very smart; it would prevent us to make any changes to the good commit without compromising the commit history, ot it will need branching later anyway. I wanted to get your opinion on what is the best way to proceed. How should I work with the collaborators, move between branches, etc? Do we need to use git to move and create branches?\r\n\r\n#### What steps will reproduce the problem?\r\nNA\r\n\r\n#### What version of DataLad are you using (run `datalad --version`)? On what operating system (consider running `datalad wtf`)?\r\n0.13.1 until yesterday, and 0.14.0 from now on\r\n\r\n#### Is there anything else that would be useful to know in this context?\r\nNA\r\n\r\n#### Have you had any success using DataLad before? (to assess your expertise/prior luck.  We would welcome your testimonial additions to https://github.com/datalad/datalad/wiki/Testimonials as well)\r\n:)", "closed_by": {"login": "dorianps", "id": 9083517, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjkwODM1MTc=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9083517?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/dorianps", "html_url": "https://github.com/dorianps", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dorianps/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dorianps/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dorianps/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dorianps/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dorianps/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dorianps/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dorianps/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dorianps/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dorianps/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/5414/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/5414/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
