I don't need to move it, just rename the folder. The handbook says that one can just use the linux `mv` command and there will be no problem (I don't have siblings etc.):\r\nhttp://handbook.datalad.org/en/latest/basics/101-136-filesystem.html#moving-renaming-a-superdataset\r\n\r\nBut since a git submodule is registered with a path, I don't see how this is not a problem. Can you please let me know what is the right way to do it. I.e., rename `data123` to `data12`.\r\n\r\n#### What steps will reproduce the problem?\r\nNA\r\n\r\n#### What version of DataLad are you using (run `datalad --version`)? On what operating system (consider running `datalad wtf`)?\r\n0.12.1 (installed via github link few days ago)\r\nBy the way, `datalad wtf` does work efficiently anymore. It hangs there and took over 1 minute to respond, timing below:\r\n```\r\nreal\t1m28.283s\r\nuser\t0m3.349s\r\nsys\t0m2.434s\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Is there anything else that would be useful to know in this context?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n#### Have you had any success using DataLad before?
