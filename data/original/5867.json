This draft description is not about making a contrast to\r\nwhat the present drop is doing (there are massive overlaps), but about a\r\ncomprehensible concept of what drop does, and does not. The initial\r\ndesign draft is the result of a discussion of @adswa and @mih.\r\n\r\nA discussion of this already started in #5832. In favor of a more formal\r\ndiscussion and, importantly, adjustment process of this proposal, it\r\nwill be resubmitted as a PR, not as an issue.\r\n\r\nI have made an attempt to ease precise referencing particular aspects via exhaustive numbering.
