We tried using **datalad siblings remove -s SIBLINGNAME** and **git annex dead SIBLINGNAME**.  When we run **datalad siblings** in the input dataset, the only listed sibling is **here**; however, our when we try to datalad run the analysis we still see attempts to clone from the remote RIA sibling that has already been removed. Is there a way to confirm the sibling we removed is actually gone? We are not sure why this is happening and would welcome any insights. @mattcieslak ", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/5977/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/5977/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
