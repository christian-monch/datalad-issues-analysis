As of PR #1299, this leads to a call to `create-sibling` with settings inherited from the superdataset if a dataset is missing the sibling in question.\r\nWhile it's okay to have this and play with it a little bit, this approach won't stand reality ;-)\r\nAs I pointed out in #1299, I think this should either be just `add-sibling` or we an even more complex strategy altogether.\r\nThe reason is, that first of all `create-sibling` might easily fail due to missing permissions of the publisher,second it's somewhat weird to let datalad's counterpart of `git push` actually create a new repository at the remote and third (may be even most important): We already have _two_ `create-sibling` commands and there may well be more in the future. By now, `publish` can't decide which kind of `create-sibling` is needed.\r\n\r\nBottom line: Two possibilities from my point of view:\r\n\r\n- keep it simple and only allow for `add-sibling` from within `publish`\r\n- `create-sibling` must leave an indication of itself (which kind) in the repo's `.datalad/config` and `publish` then would need to read that and call the respective command. Even then, `publish` would need to just try creating the thing, if it fails at least add it, then try using it to publish and if still fails ... well, skip_failed or even more options to set ...", "closed_by": {"login": "mih", "id": 136479, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjQ3OQ==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/136479?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih", "html_url": "https://github.com/mih", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/1344/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/1344/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
