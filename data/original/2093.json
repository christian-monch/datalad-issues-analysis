As for merges as far as I can see there could be two types:\r\n- we merge in something we were not asked to replay (although it might contain RUN'ed commits on its history, but they are all outside of our \"replay revision range\") -- we can just (try to) merge as well.  Sure thing if merge fails -- we would be stuck, hence #2092\r\n- we have split(s) and merge(s) of those split trees between our revA and revB. That is trickier since we would need to replay all those parallel trees the same way (but oh boy it would be cool) and then perform the merge (possibly merging in also some independent other tree if it was threeway merge).\r\n\r\nFirst case above though hints on ambiguity of `--since=` in #2076 -- will it be only the leftmost (if two parallel trees, possibly with a common ancestor but may be not in some obscure cases) commit, or all \"first\" commits in those parallel branches?  probably the later.  if they all have a common commit, and above merge handling is implemented we could just replay from that common commit (with all the standard branching/merging), but if they are separate -- would require ... actually not much -- just recalling the hexsha of an empty initial (absent) commit and replaying from there? ;)", "closed_by": {"login": "kyleam", "id": 1297788, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTc3ODg=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1297788?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam", "html_url": "https://github.com/kyleam", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/2093/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/2093/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
