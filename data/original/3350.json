The current `AnnexRepo.whereis()` is not suitable for this. It aims to be universal and fails at it. Given that `annex whereis` does not support all queries in batched mode, I decided that it would be best to have a dedicated implementation for path queries.\r\n\r\nIn contrast to the previous whereis() this one has:\r\n\r\n- a simpler API (no options at all)\r\n- cannot query for a key (not possible in batched mode)\r\n- cannot do recursive queries (not possible in batched mode)\r\n- states what file a response belongs too\r\n\r\nI comes in two flavors: single-path queries, and generator for multi-path queries.\r\n\r\nI also include an RF for `BatchedCommand` that adds a `yield_()` method which bypasses the collect-everything-into-a-list-first approach, which torpedos generator-style usage.\r\n\r\nI will adjust the tests, once it is clear to me that this solution is optimal for the metadata use case.", "closed_by": {"login": "mih", "id": 136479, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjQ3OQ==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/136479?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih", "html_url": "https://github.com/mih", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/3350/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/3350/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
