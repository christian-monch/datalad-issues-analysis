needs RFing, but I wanted first to run by you the idea.of having a URL class, which would expose pretty much all attributes which named tuple ParseResults return, but which\n- supports ssh \"urls\", or possibly other \"implicit\"ly defined schemes (e.g. host:: for rsync?)\n- supports our ad-hoc perspective '//[remote]/[dataset]' urls\n\n`is_url` now should report ssh urls as urls as well\n\nplease look at `test_url` functions either you would agree with such behavior... or may be ':implicit' suffix should just migrate into 'implicit' attribute of URL?\n\nAims to close #440, #493, #441 \n\nTODO:\n- [x] address #440 -- should be just defer to `str(URL(scheme='file', path=abspath(path)))`\n- [x] address #441 while providing compatibility so we could still work with already generated datasets with archives\n", "closed_by": {"login": "mih", "id": 136479, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjQ3OQ==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/136479?v=4", "gravatar_id":
