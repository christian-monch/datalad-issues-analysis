I'd\r\n    rather not have the config option result in such divergent behavior as\r\n    `git annex add .` skipping a dotfile (old) vs adding to annex (new).\r\n    \r\n    Note that the assistant always adds dotfiles to the annex.\r\n    This is surprising, but not new behavior. Might be worth making it also\r\n    honor annex.dotfiles, but I wonder if perhaps some user somewhere uses\r\n    it and keeps large files in a directory that happens to begin with a\r\n    dot. Since dotfiles and dotdirs are a unix culture thing, and the\r\n    assistant users may not be part of that culture, it seems best to keep\r\n    its current behavior for now.\r\n```\r\n\r\nso we need to \"adapt\"", "closed_by": {"login": "kyleam", "id": 1297788, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTc3ODg=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1297788?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam", "html_url": "https://github.com/kyleam", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/4213/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/4213/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
