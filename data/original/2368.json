E.g. we have http://datasets.datalad.org/?dir=/dicoms/rosetta/ where theoretically subdasets could be at the 2nd level of subdirectories to correspond to  a sample from a particular scanner.  When we do queries/reporting we can only report on a file or dataset  and not per directory.  \r\nI wondered if it it could be somehow allowed for some directories to provide their own level of aggregation (indicated e.g. by having `.datalad/` subdir, possibly with `.datalad/config` which would prescribe extractors)\r\nNote: that a dataset is also a directory ;)", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/2368/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/2368/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
