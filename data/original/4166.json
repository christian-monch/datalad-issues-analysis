At the same time, we have `@skip_ssh` to mark tests that require SSH and the respective `DATALAD_TESTS_SSH` to enable it.\r\nI think we should have a dedicated build (matrix?), that would run the SSH tests *only* and have the other builds *not* run them. Otherwise we will exceed the time limit for Travis runs. Also: There are often paired tests - one for SSH one for local thing. An SSH build doesn't need to run the ones that a non-SSH build already ran. In `git-annex-ria-remote` (and therefore in PR #4164) I have an opposing decorator, that would skip a test if `DATALAD_TESTS_SSH` is *not* set. That way we could mark such pairs where it's sufficient to run either one of the tests.\r\nAlternatively we might want to have a marking decorator, that could be discovered by nose (like `@usecase`)  - didn't look into that yet.\r\n\r\nEither way - a separation in dedicated builds is needed, I guess.
