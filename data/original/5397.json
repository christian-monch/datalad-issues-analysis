Since this not a bug per se, but a rather large feature-request involving datalad too, I created a [neurostars.org thread on this](https://neurostars.org/t/using-datalad-for-provenance-tracking-in-nipype-how-to/18132). Feel free to close this issue, and reply your thoughts on neurostars instead. To get the nipype devs to see the post too, I'm posting a similar issue over at the nipype repo as well.\r\n", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/5397/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/5397/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
