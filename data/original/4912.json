I don't think this is the way to go.\r\nIs there a motivation to do it this way, that I might have missed, @mih?\r\n\r\nOtherwise I'd like to change that, so that we have an independent runner in `GitRepo` first and only change it to the `ConfigManager`'s once the property actually instantiates it. When creating a repo it's done this way anyway, obv.\r\n", "closed_by": {"login": "kyleam", "id": 1297788, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTc3ODg=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1297788?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam", "html_url": "https://github.com/kyleam", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/4912/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/4912/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
