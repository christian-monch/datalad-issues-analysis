However, the outer layer in `interface`, the arg parsing, etc. do actually have that information. We could simply set a module attribute in `datalad`, `datalad.api` or may be `datalad.interface` to store a flag, that can then be used by code deeper down.\r\n\r\nWDYT, @datalad/developers ?\r\n", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/6081/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/6081/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
