In an attempt to fix #5547, this PR records the use of ``--explicit`` in a run record.\r\nIn an attempt to start a conversation about how to handle the presence of ``explicit = true`` records during rerun, the second commit in this PR also (in a quite encroaching manner) lets the original ``--explicit`` flag \"override\" a non-set ``--explicit`` flag in a rerun. The second commit is not sufficient, because it completely lacks critical thoughts or solutions on what @kyleam noted in the original issue:\r\n\r\n> At least one thing that would need to be carefully thought through is the interaction between rerunning explicit and non-explicit commits. For example, if rerun first processes an explicit=True commit followed by an explict=False one, rerunning without any further checks will result in that commit absorbing unrelated changes.\r\n\r\nI secretly hope that someone is so offended by this bad commit that it starts a conversation on how to handle this. I couldn't come up with a solution, but maybe someone else has a good idea. At the very least, with the first commit ``--explicit`` is recorded, even if we decide to not yet act on it.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/5686/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/5686/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
