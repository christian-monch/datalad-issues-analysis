The problem is that we do not have any type of fixture to share the same dataset across multiple runs of tests so it downloads it over and over again.  Instead of coming up with a (pytest) fixture we (with @leej3) thought it would be nice if datalad provided `.testing` module (similar to the one in numpy and other toolkits like pymvpa) which either provided testing platform specific fixtures or just helper functions like `get_testing_dataset(\"///openfmri/ds0000001\", version=\"1.0.0-or-hexsha\", get='sub*')`", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/2667/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/2667/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
