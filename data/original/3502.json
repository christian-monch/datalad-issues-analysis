Both `git status` nor `datalad status` provide per file (changed or untracked) output which often just floods the screen making it impossible to actually comprehend current status (besides tree being dirty) without rerunning the command and piping it into `less` and then browsing it for a while.\r\nI think it would be nice to have something like `git diff --stat` or summary rendering like we have in other commands just presenting overall summary **without** flooding the terminal, e.g.\r\n```\r\nuntracked(file): 2000\r\nmodified(file): 1000\r\nremoved(file): 1000\r\n```\r\nand so on, may be even without `(file)` indicator although if we could provide information about subdatasets (e.g. `modified(subdataset): 2` and `dirty(subdataset): 1`) -- would be great.\r\n\r\nAnd we have already something like that but for actions, since we do add `action summary:`  at the end in the default renderer.  But that is not in effect for `status` since there is no actual action taken, and in general it provides status for **all** the files, not only the ones of \"interest\" as reported by its renderer ATM (modified/untracked etc)\r\n\r\nSo I wondered if we should/could\r\n-  add explicit `-f stats` which would suppress individual messages and only output summary at the end\r\n- make it work also for `datalad status`\r\n?", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/3502/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/3502/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
