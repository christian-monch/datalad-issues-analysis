Whenever people are transitioning from using \"just Git\" to DataLad, I get asked what they should do to their existing repos. My answer is `datalad create --force`. But this leads to annex the following annex output for any repo that has a remote:\r\n```\r\n(datalad3-dev) mih@meiner /tmp % datalad clone git@github.com:datalad-handbook/book.git\r\ninstall(ok): /tmp/book (dataset)                                                             \r\n(datalad3-dev) mih@meiner /tmp % cd book\r\n(datalad3-dev) mih@meiner /tmp/book (git)-[master] % datalad create --force\r\n[INFO   ] Creating a new annex repo at /tmp/book \r\n[INFO   ]   Unable to parse git config from origin \r\n[INFO   ]   Remote origin does not have git-annex installed; setting annex-ignore \r\n[INFO   ]   This could be a problem with the git-annex installation on the remote. Please make sure that git-annex-shell is available in PATH when you ssh into the remote. Once you have fixed the git-annex installation, run: git annex enableremote origin \r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen I stand next to people the first time, I can explain and it is not a problem. Few weeks later I get an email asking me what they are doing wrong. The only \"solution\" I can come up with is to wrap this message into another one that explains the non-severity of the issue. But this would also increase the flood of information.\r\n\r\nI think part of the confusion comes from the fact that `create --force` feels like a local operations, but `annex init` inside talks to remotes too.", "closed_by": {"login": "mih", "id": 136479, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjQ3OQ==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/136479?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih", "html_url": "https://github.com/mih", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/4402/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/4402/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
