In common DataLad\r\nscenarios (see gh-3538), installing a subdataset using a local path\r\nsource can lead to .git/config URLs such as\r\n\r\n    url = /tmp/super/../source\r\n\r\nA downside of these absolute paths is that they become invalid for\r\nURLs that point within a dataset hierarchy (e.g., \"../../source\") if\r\nthe hierarchy is moved to a different location.  With relative URLs,\r\nthe URLs would remain valid as long the relative relationships are\r\nretained.  (On the other hand, absolute paths provide a better\r\nstability when moving datasets if the URLs point outside of the\r\nhierarchy.)\r\n\r\nTwo recent commits from gh-3966, 02e2b4c46 (BF: Avoid relpath mangling\r\nfor submodule url configuration, 2020-01-10) followed up by 0a80bb47e\r\n(BF: submodule relpath must start with ./ or ../, 2020-01-10), tried\r\nto avoid these absolute URLs.  The combined result says \"if the URL\r\ngiven is a local path and is relative, overwrite the configured URL\r\nwith that path (prepending ./ if the path doesn't start with ../)\".\r\n\r\nHowever, this logic points the URL to the wrong location.  Here are\r\nsome examples (similar to the cases the added test):\r\n\r\n  * For `git clone a b`, the correct location from _within_ repo b\r\n    would \"../a\", not \"./a\".\r\n\r\n  * Similarly, for `git clone ../a b`, the correct location would be\r\n    \"../../a\", not \"../a\"\r\n\r\n  * Calling `git clone a ../b` from $DIR, the correct location would\r\n    \"$DIR/a\", not \"./a\".\r\n\r\nAn alternative approach is needed, but it seems unlikely to have a\r\nquick and obviously correct fix, so let's revert the changes from\r\n02e2b4c46 and 0a80bb47e to avoid these invalid URLs.\r\n\r\nRe-opens gh-3538.\r\n", "closed_by": {"login": "mih", "id": 136479, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjQ3OQ==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/136479?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih", "html_url": "https://github.com/mih", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/4025/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/4025/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
