This  could be used in other places too. Such as \"`get` data for all files that were changed `--since`\". Which could be used for the presently not-implemented `update --reobtain-data` (ping #1199).\r\n- [X] reimplement `publish` to perform upfront checks and sorting without recursive self-invocation at the top-level. Recursive calls are still used to handle publication dependencies, but only a cheap helper call is used for this purpose\r\n- [X] let `publish` look harder to figure out if anything needs to be pushed at all\r\n- [x] sift through the function signature to see what kind of values/object should be passed to yield most flexibility\r\n- [x] reevaluate where in the logic publication dependencies should be detected and acted upon\r\n", "closed_by": {"login": "mih", "id": 136479, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjQ3OQ==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/136479?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih", "html_url": "https://github.com/mih", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/1203/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/1203/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
