I know that I can get this from the debug log, but maybe it could shorten the \"design phase\" of a `run` command when the effective command could be displayed directly and in a simpler fashion somehow.\r\n\r\nI am not certain which approach would work best here. Intuitively, I'd say that some kind of `--dry-run` mode would be beneficial that could inform about the command after all transformations, and possibly matching inputs/outputs.", "closed_by": {"login": "mih", "id": 136479, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjQ3OQ==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/136479?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih", "html_url": "https://github.com/mih", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/5538/reactions", "total_count": 2, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 1, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/5538/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
