In this\r\nscenario, avoid failing early so that argcomplete can do its thing.\r\n\r\nCloses #4473.\r\n\r\n[*]: When I tried from fb38c7098^, completion still didn't work\r\n     because an exception is raised in config.py due to cfg_kv_regex\r\n     not matching when datalad is run under argcomplete (for reasons I\r\n     haven't looked into).  But, when I worked around that error,\r\n     _then_ fb38c7098 broke completion.
