Webapp components can come from datalad itself, but also from system or user content (idea and mechanism resemble a plugin).\r\n\r\nThe whole thing is built on cherrypy (yes, not flask), I like classes. It can handle everything I could think of. I included pointers to run it on daemon mode, on privileged ports (commented out ATM), serving static files, session management, ....\r\n\r\nA demo webapp is included that does very little, but shows how we can relay our internal JSON-like results to the outside world, provide and eat forms, and serve static files.\r\n\r\nTo try it out you can run:\r\n\r\n`datalad webapp -d <somedatasetwithmetadata> --app metadata`\r\n\r\nthen visit http://localhost:8080 to play with it. E.g. query metadata: http://localhost:8080/m?path=.\r\n\r\nAlternatively run:\r\n\r\n`datalad webapp -d <somedatasetwithmetadata> --app metadata /mountpoint`\r\n\r\nto \"mount\" the webapp under http://localhost:8080/mountpoint (all methods and static files will move logically under the path). The included static file would then be found under http://localhost:8080/mountpoint/this.css. There is no mandatory \"static\" or something like this in the path to give complete flexibility, so a webapp could also simple serve the full content of a dataset.\r\n\r\nThere is a bit of dynamic config being done in the `webapp` command, but each app can also be configured using a proper config file (one example is also included).\r\n\r\nPlease have a look @datalad/developers\r\n", "closed_by": {"login": "mih", "id": 136479, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjQ3OQ==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/136479?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih", "html_url": "https://github.com/mih", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/2212/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/2212/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
