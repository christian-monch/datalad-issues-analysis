I was under the impression that we are moving towards caring for datalad datasets, not any repository. But given the recent misconceptions:\n\nWhat about the case where a dataset, contains a repository submodule (no dataset), which in turn contains a dataset.\n\nIMHO the only clean way is to ignore anything from the submodule downward (including the submodule). If we ignore it in the metadata, we should likely ignore it in things like `get_subdataset()`, to avoid proliferation of dataset flavors. If we don't want to ignore it, we have to be able to describe it, hence plain repos will keep getthing an ID ... IWO things stay the way they are and issues  like #986 are invalid.\n\nIf we want to ignore it, how can we tell a subdataset from a submodule without having it installed?\n\nLikewise, what if I have a plain repository that contains submodules which are dataset? While the top is not a dataset? Do we have to consider it to be one nevertheless, because it would make sense to search in it? In this case the resolution of #997 becomes more complicated than it seemed at first.\n\nDecision please.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "mih", "id": 136479, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjQ3OQ==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/136479?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih", "html_url": "https://github.com/mih", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/1010/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/1010/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
