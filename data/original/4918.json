This is nice as a self-contained representation, but generates detached copies that put needless strain on storage systems.\r\n\r\nWith datalad we could easily drop these files. However, we have no way of getting them back, unless their original location is reachable via some URL and `copy-file` can be used.\r\n\r\nI think we should have means to say \"get this key from this subdataset\". Ideally, this would be handled by the `datalad` special remote, analog to archive processing. Specifically, on `get` it obtains the referenced subdataset, and after successful installation, fetches the file key from whatever referenced location, and makes the key available in the superdataset.\r\n\r\nIt would make sense to reference subdatasets by their UUID to be able to support more global resolution approaches later on.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/4918/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/4918/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
