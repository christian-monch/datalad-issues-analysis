Currently, when requesting the file content a second time, the following error is thrown:\r\n```bash\r\nTotal (0 ok, 1 failed out of 1):   0%| | 0.00/61.5M [00:00<?, ?B/s][WARNING] Running get resulted in stderr output: git-annex: get: 1 failed\r\n \r\n                                                                      [ERROR  ] transfer already in progress, or unable to take transfer lock; Unable to access these remotes: google; Try making some of these repositories available:; \t9b7e766e-eecb-4cc9-a893-cb6329d1fe1b -- [google]; ; (Note that these git remotes have annex-ignore set: github) [get(/home/simon/Documents/carmin-server/data/admin/test82/9.txt)] \r\nget(error): /home/simon/Documents/carmin-server/data/admin/test82/9.txt (file) [transfer already in progress, or unable to take transfer lock; Unable to access these remotes: google; Try making some of these repositories available:; \t9b7e766e-eecb-4cc9-a893-cb6329d1fe1b -- [google]; ; (Note that these git remotes have annex-ignore set: github)]\r\n```\r\nNote: The error was formatted this way in my terminal.\r\n\r\nI looked at the Datalad documentation and didn't find any option that would, when calling `datalad get` on a given file another time, wait for the first `get` operation to complete and then exit normally. Such an option would solve some of the possible issues our platform could encounter through its usage of Datalad. (Please ping @glatard if further information is needed)  \r\n \r\n#### What steps will reproduce the problem?\r\n1. Publish a large file to a remote sibling.\r\n3. Drop the large file.\r\n2. Perform 2 concurrent `get` operations of the large file.\r\n\r\n#### What version of DataLad are you using?\r\nDatalad: datalad 0.10.1\r\nOS: Ubuntu 18.04.1 LTS\r\nRemotes: Github with a dependency to Google Drive\r\n\r\n#### Have you had any success using DataLad before?\r\nI have been using Datalad a lot throughout the last 7 weeks and I really enjoyed my experience. It was very challenging at first due to the particular use cases I had and the technological stack that git-annex and Datalad both represent for newcomers, but very straight forward and easy to use once the workflow is understood.\r\n", "closed_by": {"login": "yarikoptic", "id": 39889, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjM5ODg5", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39889?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic", "html_url": "https://github.com/yarikoptic", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/2768/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/2768/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
