But that is IMHO an undesirable default behavior:\r\n\r\n- quite often people do not have all the files in the repository (containers etc), and want to publish what they have -- complaining about files they do not have be just wrong and distracting (could be many more from what they actually desire to share/publish)\r\n- I might not want to publish stuff which is already available elsewhere (e.g. containers)\r\n- only a matter of time until pushing of all data by default would leak some sensitive data into public space \r\n- I typically do not push all the data by default. I rely on `wanted` set and `--auto` (see further discussion on --auto in #4550) \r\n\r\nSuch default behavior is a radical change from `publish` behavior where by default no data was published, so I could feel save running `datalad publish -r` on a hierarchy.  With \"copy by default\" - I would not dare (\"did I forget to set restrictive 'wanted' to some repo?  did I set wanted good enough to not transfer some containers I would prefer to not copy but do have locally?\")\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n$> datalad --version\r\ndatalad 0.13.0rc1.dev52\r\n```\r\n\r\nedit: fixed referenced issue to be #4550 not 4541", "closed_by": {"login": "yarikoptic", "id": 39889, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjM5ODg5", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39889?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic", "html_url": "https://github.com/yarikoptic", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/4551/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/4551/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
