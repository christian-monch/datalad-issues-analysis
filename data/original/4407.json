The easy part to fix is to write assertions about the\r\ncurrent branch using get_corresponding_branch (written a bit oddly for\r\ncompatibility with the changed return value in master).\r\n\r\nThe more involved part is changing the setup in test_clone_unborn_head\r\nto account for the fact that, while setting up, we may be on an\r\nadjusted branch.  This means we can't use empty commits, because\r\ngit-annex diffs to decide whether things need to be propagated back.\r\nAnd we need to sprinkle in calls to adjust() followed by save() to\r\nsync state.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis should resolve the CrippledFS failures mentioned in gh-4405.  Note that this is branched from maint, but the initial base on the PR is master.  This is so the CrippledFS is triggered.  Once I confirm that it passes, I'll change the base to maint.\r\n", "closed_by": {"login": "kyleam", "id": 1297788, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTc3ODg=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1297788?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam", "html_url": "https://github.com/kyleam", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/4407/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/4407/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
