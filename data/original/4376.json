I am trying to download private datasets/files using `datalad.api.download_url`, however, the [server](https://developer.osf.io/#tag/Authentication) serving the private files only allows downloads when authenticated by passing the token via the header of the REST call. Is there a way to pass a token via header using Datalad when using `download_url`?\r\n#### What version of DataLad are you using (run `datalad --version`)? On what operating system (consider running `datalad wtf`)?\r\ndatalad 0.12.2\r\nUbuntu/18.04/bionic\r\n\r\n#### Have you had any success using DataLad before? (to assess your expertise/prior luck.
