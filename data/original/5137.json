proper operation on windows:\r\n\r\n1. Create a dataset with a subdataset\r\n2. Verify that the subdataset's corresponding branch commit is registered in the superdataset\r\n2. Push both datasets to a remote (maybe a RIA store so it could capture #5134 too)\r\n3. Verify that managed branches were not pushed but only properly synced corresponding branches\r\n4. Clone the superdataset into a different location\r\n5. Install the subdataset into it\r\n6. Verify that the right subdataset commit is checked out, or rather a managed branch based on the right commit\r\n7. Verify that the super/subdataset is not reported modified by `datalad status` (while `git-status` will likely report modification).\r\n\r\nGiven the persistent incompatibility of the testrepo setup, specifically with appveyor, such test should not be based on that.", "closed_by": {"login": "mih", "id": 136479, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjQ3OQ==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/136479?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih", "html_url": "https://github.com/mih", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/5137/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/5137/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
