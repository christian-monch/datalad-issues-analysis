Except from places where `exc_str` was used to create a `message` in a (result) dict, this PR only provides the means - it does NOT fully implement the usage pattern. This would again be a huge diff and (I think) should involve similar changes to the higher level log messages as its predecessor. From my POV it's better to get this merged as is and I can then provide those changes in reviewable and discussable batches against `maint` - no need to include them in a particular release. Therefore `exc_str` still exists (but doesn't return empty) and is still used. However, there's no need for `exc_str_old` anymore, hence removed.\r\n\r\nAlso removed config `datalad.log.exc` again. Since the detailed logging is at low level, I think there's no need to additionally enable/disable it.\r\n\r\nCloses #5848 \r\n\r\nUPDATE: Please consider the included design document.", "closed_by": {"login": "bpoldrack", "id": 10498301, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDk4MzAx", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10498301?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bpoldrack", "html_url": "https://github.com/bpoldrack", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bpoldrack/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bpoldrack/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bpoldrack/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bpoldrack/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bpoldrack/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bpoldrack/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bpoldrack/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bpoldrack/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bpoldrack/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/5954/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/5954/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
