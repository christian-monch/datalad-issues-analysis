In contrast, `datalad.tests.utils.with_tree` does **not** resolve symlinks.  This leads to confusing (at least to me) situations like the one in b4b310458 (more [here]), where a test with TMPDIR=\"/var/tmp/sym link\" will pass when `with_tempfile` is used and fail when `with_tree` is used.\r\n\r\nSo I wonder if we should drop the `realpath` in `make_tempfile`\r\n\r\n  * so that `with_tempfile` behaves the same as `with_tree`\r\n\r\n  * to see if using `with_tempfile` is masking any failures in the TMPDIR=\"/var/tmp/sym link\" case.\r\n\r\nBut I don't have a good understanding of this issue because a86f5756f specifically added the `realpath` call to deal with test issues.\r\n\r\n[here]: https://github.com/datalad/datalad/pull/2634#issuecomment-395847882\r\n", "closed_by": {"login": "mih", "id": 136479, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjQ3OQ==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/136479?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih", "html_url": "https://github.com/mih", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/2640/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/2640/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
