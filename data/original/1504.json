E.g. may be we need group errors having the same content and state that \"X\" failed with error msg \"blah\"?   Error message with  ` Command did not complete successfully ` dump should also become human friendly and limit amount of output.  It is after all just a log message and we have \"proper\" return values now happen someone really need to analyze what is going on.\r\n", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/1504/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/1504/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
