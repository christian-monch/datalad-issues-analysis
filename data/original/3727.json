Nobody got excited, but I kept thinking about it because  often we annex context which is not necessarily \"too large\" to push it to github.  It might be that I need to share files which\r\n- need to be encrypted if shared publicly;\r\n- I know that later on might not need on every clone (thus shouldn't just go to git)\r\n- are sizeable but not huge, but I know that committing them to git is a crime, but they would fit nicely to github\r\n- I might need to make unavailable later on without rewriting entire history\r\n- I might need to keep only the most recent version available publicly/from that repository\r\n\r\nSo, welcome the prototype (in bash) for now of `git-annex-remote-gitobjects` , so if you place it in your PATH (and make executable), you should be able to\r\n\r\n    datalad install -gs https://github.com/yarikoptic/testds.git\r\n\r\nand get 2 annexed files from that GitHub repo.\r\n\r\nWhat I need to figure out is  how to RF CHECKPRESENT  to avoid fetching the object pointed by the ref.  If there is no way, I have ideas for a workaround... but hopefully git gurus (@kyleam and @joeyh) would tell me HOWTO\r\n\r\nAnd then RF to store not a remote name but remoteurl as a parameter of the remote (or both?)\r\n\r\n[ci skip]", "closed_by": {"login": "yarikoptic", "id": 39889, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjM5ODg5", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39889?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic", "html_url": "https://github.com/yarikoptic", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/3727/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/3727/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
