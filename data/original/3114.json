The question whether it is possible to implement extractors in another language came up in the past, but is not currently possible.\r\n\r\nI had the realization that we are missing the most simple \"extractor\" that would make it straightforward to invent any metadata extraction/harmonization/conversion in any language while still being compatible with the rest of the metadata handling (aggregation, transport, ...).\r\n\r\nI propose to implement a `json-ld` extractor. All it would do is to check if a metadata file in JSON(+LD) format exists, and return its content. The location would be configurable. Initially, only dataset-level metadata would be supported. Later on per-file metadata support could be added. Possible mechanisms\r\nfor this could be:\r\n\r\n- side-car files\r\n- special annex metadata key\r\n- something totally different.\r\n\r\nWith such an extractor, anyone can implement any algorithm to produce optimal metadata. An algorithm could be registered in a dataset as a `procedure` that can run automatically -- thereby not breaking the paradigm that \"metadata should be update-able in an automated fashion to make it future-ready\".\r\n\r\nGiven that datalad has no idea what such metadata from be made of or come from, we should also allow for assigning an arbitrary name for it. Maybe default to `custom`, but allow for something else. This may require a change in the common code part of the extraction handling.", "closed_by": {"login": "mih", "id": 136479, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjQ3OQ==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/136479?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih", "html_url": "https://github.com/mih", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/3114/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/3114/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
