The only way I see it could be done now if `addurls` does everything but the last commit, and then actual commit is done by the `run`.\r\n\r\nI would see similar need for any command which might be coming with non-trivial specification and which might be causing the `--save` in the current branch (or `git-annex`!  we can pass commit msg to be used by annex btw):  `create-sibling`, probably some of the current plugins?\r\nMay be it is worth adding `--run` at the top datalad interface level which would trigger pre-generation of the commit message with information about which command was invoked so it would be used during `save` operation.  Tricky points:\r\n-- there might be multiple `save`'s for a single `datalad` command.\r\n\r\nWe might see interaction with `crawl` to some degree. now a dedicated `crawl-init` is used (with the \"plugin\" way to specify options) which stores crawler parameters under `.datalad/crawl/crawl.cfg` but kinda an idea is the same -- I am just recording options for the invocation of `crawl` (if I were to unify/meld `crawl-init` and `crawl`)...", "closed_by": {"login": "yarikoptic", "id": 39889, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjM5ODg5", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39889?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic", "html_url": "https://github.com/yarikoptic", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/2280/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/2280/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
