So we could then say:\r\n```\r\n* annex.largefiles=(mimeencoding=binary)\r\n```\r\nwhich is kinda neat IMHO!  But that would require adding support for that to git-annex\r\n- We could (potentially, since there is [a bug in file/libmagic forbidding it](https://bugs.astron.com/view.php?id=77)) use `-k, --keep-going` flag and get all entries for each file to be matched.  But that would also require changes to git-annex and possibly more substantial since probably it was not coded to associate multiple mime types per file\r\n\r\nThere is also `-e json` which could be added to `file` call to exclude detection of json, but if anything (again, changed in annex) it would be a dirty hack/workaround, nothing really to rely upon.\r\n\r\n# Temporary workaround\r\nSo I guess, in the short run, we should just add explicit \r\n```\r\n*.json annex.largefiles=nothing\r\n```\r\nor alike (limit by size in addition).\r\n\r\nAny other ideas?", "closed_by": {"login": "kyleam", "id": 1297788, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTc3ODg=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1297788?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam", "html_url": "https://github.com/kyleam", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/3361/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/3361/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
