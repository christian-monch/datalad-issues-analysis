There are quite a few, hence this would be a project of some size. https://github.com/datalad/datalad/pull/3883 already started, and https://github.com/datalad/datalad/pull/3893 suggests to add special meaning to a `-m` without an option. There is also: https://github.com/datalad/datalad/issues/3882\r\n\r\nIt would be good to thing to think this through a bit more and then make one consolidated effort (or at least a plan for such).\r\n\r\n**Keep it minimal**: we have plenty of command that need message opts, but `save` as two (`-m` and `-F`). I propose to kill `-F` and replace it with a `file:` argument prefix detection than is then accessible to all commands\r\n\r\n**Centralize**: Message file handling should move out of `save` and be extended to a  common helper that deal with any message handling. I think it is worth pondering whether we want a class/function that can be used internally to signal and handle interactive message input, like approached in #3893, possibly with templating for subdatasets as done in https://github.com/datalad/datalad-revolution/pull/71. But there is another templating aspect too: https://github.com/datalad/datalad/issues/2100\r\n\r\n**What about tagging?**: https://github.com/datalad/datalad/issues/3371", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/3896/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/3896/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
