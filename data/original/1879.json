For example:\r\nAn index of the list of commits is not exactly telling! If the determination of a commit that is part of an assertion was based on it's message, a human being would be able to understand what the assertion is about. :-)\r\n#### What steps will reproduce the problem?\r\nParticularly any change in the number, order or tree of the commits.\r\n#### Is there anything else that would be useful to know in this context?\r\nYes. Have a look at the changes and particularly the comments in 29a3d87cac5c69331d77327505bd8ed78485978e\r\n#### Have you had any success using DataLad before?
