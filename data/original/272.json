Don't think sphinx-autosummary has been used for something like that.\n\nIssue 1) we cannot easily get a call signature for those class instances -- because they are class instances. It may be possible to make classes from datalad.interfaces look like functions in datalad.api, but this need some vodka and a whole night.\n\nIssue 2) Currently we practice numpydoc conventions. If we do not want to give that up (don't think we should) we need python-numpydoc in order to build the docs (hence needs to go into requirements.txt)\n", "closed_by": {"login": "mih", "id": 136479, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjQ3OQ==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/136479?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih", "html_url": "https://github.com/mih", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/272/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/272/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
