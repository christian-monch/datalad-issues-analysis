The default is ``git-remote``, but at the moment it also takes ``drive`` or ``any``\r\n- If anything but ``git-remote`` is specified, an rclone-based special remote is configured.\r\n    - If ``drive`` is given, a special remote to Google drive is configured (with no further arguments, the default configuration is used, but the optional arguments ``apikey`` and ``apisecret`` can be given to specify ``client_id`` and ``client_secret``. \r\n   - If ``--type any`` is given  or if ``-i/--interactive`` is specified, the interactive ``rclone configure`` command is started.\r\n- After configuration, the special remote is initialized.\r\n   - Without additional arguments, the following ``git annex init`` call is used: ``git annex init <remote-name> encryption=none externaltype='rclone' chunk=50MiB type=external prefix=datalad/<ds-ID> rclone_layout=lower target=<remote-name>``\r\n   - Alternatively, ``encryption``, ``layout``, ``chunk``, ``prefix`` can also be given as arguments to the command line call\r\n\r\nCurrently, I can do something like this to configure a special remote called \"mygdrive\" as an rclone based Gdrive special remote with my Google API key:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndatalad siblings add --type 'drive' -s mygdrive --apikey '774309559379-sapf1isni06pfnoahes23ldsm08jaa8qx.apps.googleusercontent.com' --apisecret '9l7iR5a2u2lHHocfNs862fPx'\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt would be cool if you could check whether the general approach makes sense. I'm opening it as a draft because there is still a lot missing:\r\n\r\n- I don't know how to write tests for an interactive process\r\n- I don't know yet how to do result handling/reporting in the end. After successful command completion I would also like to provide an example command as help on how to configure the special remote as a publication dependency\r\n- It's inconvenient that when started interactively, ``-s/--name`` given to the command and the name given in the interactive configuration need to match. Else, it fails with a not very helpful error\r\n- This currently only does the configuration for the ``publishing`` part of sharing a dataset, but it doesn't take care of the \"receiving end\", i.e. configuration a special remote and enabling it for user who want to obtain the dataset contents from a clone\r\n- Documentation\r\n", "closed_by": {"login": "mih", "id": 136479, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjQ3OQ==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/136479?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih", "html_url": "https://github.com/mih", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/4162/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/4162/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
