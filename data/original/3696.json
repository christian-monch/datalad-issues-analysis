So may be then I could use `--proc-post` to do that.  Such procedure should get a list of modified files in the last commit, and run `git annex metadata -s ` on them.  Then we should be able to use it with a regular `datalad save` or `datalad run` (may be! since it might happen that `run` doesn't save any new results.. not yet sure what to do about that).    It is also partially due to the inability to specify those via `.gitattributes`: https://git-annex.branchable.com/git-annex-metadata/#comment-fde59930f108af0fff842f5e25351e93\r\n\r\nSample use cases\r\n\r\n- adding materials which should be annotated with some distribution-restrictions git annex metadata, e.g.\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n$ datalad --proc-post annex-metadata-outputs distribution-restrictions=sensitive save -m \"Added various license files\" licenses/*\r\n```\r\n- annotating sensitive logs\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n$ datalad --proc-post annex-metadata-outputs distribution-restrictions=sensitive containers-run -m \"Running subject X\" --output logs/* -n containers/repronim-ptb-3 scripts/myexperiment.m\r\n```\r\n\r\nI still feel that simply specifying in `.gitattributes` some action to do on the matching files would be the most consistent and reliable way.  That is why I am still wondering if such a procedure worth pursuing.  May be in the scope of `metalad` it needs to generalize even further (attach not only git annex metadata) anyways.\r\n\r\nSo -- the issue is open for discussion", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/3696/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/3696/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
