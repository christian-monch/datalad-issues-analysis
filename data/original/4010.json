Besides `get` I think `update` should get  such capability.  \r\nI think such operation should be default mode of operation for `datalad update --merge`, but it might be desired to disable this mode in some cases. So it might be worth RFing `--reobtain-data` into `--data={auto,reobtain,nothing}` . With `auto` (being default) it doing the `get --auto` if wanted is set for a local clone.\r\n\r\nActually probably it should also obtain an option similar to `--missing`of `publish` (e.g. `--new`) to specify what should be done to new subdatasets which didn't exist before.  With \"inherit\" value it should then inherit \"wanted\" settings (that is what `datalad publish --missing=inherit` would do).  The point is to make it address the most common usecase(s) which would require such functionality (currently e.g. @soichih 's attempt to keep a hierarchy of datalad datasets in sync and having all files he needs for ingestion).
