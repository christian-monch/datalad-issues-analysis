AFAICT this is because garbage collection isn't that fast. Those processes are tied to an `AnnexRepo` instance, which isn't immediately destroyed if we leave the context of the last reference (like in a test decorator running the actual test within `try ... finally`). Therefore those processes aren't closed yet. Originally fixed the issue by adding `gc.collect()` into such `finally`-clause in PR #4842.\r\nLooking for other spots that are likely to create a similar issue, I decided to go one level down and integrate that call into `rmtree`/`rmdir` helpers.\r\n\r\nRe-enabled the windows test from above mentioned issue as proof.\r\n\r\nDisclaimer: Some situations may require #4838 in addition for this change to take full effect.", "closed_by": {"login": "bpoldrack", "id": 10498301, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDk4MzAx", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10498301?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bpoldrack", "html_url": "https://github.com/bpoldrack", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bpoldrack/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bpoldrack/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bpoldrack/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bpoldrack/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bpoldrack/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bpoldrack/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bpoldrack/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bpoldrack/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bpoldrack/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/4849/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/4849/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
