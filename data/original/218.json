It is not only about create or not create, but also about init or not init.\n\n_whining:_ I think part of the problem is actually due to decision to allow *Repo constructors to create repositories (i.e. having `create`).  E.g. now \"constructor\" might not only create and intialize a repository but also modify existing one (e.g. set backend, switch mode) etc, even if create is False.  But should it?  IMHO such actions should be done explicitly only when repository is explicitly created, or explicitly requested via corresponding methods. And imho ideally there should be a classmethod  `create` which would take that role while constructor at most would do 'init' (optionally) on top of an annex repository.  This should make code possibly longer but clearer to understand -- at any given point are we creating a repo or just loading existing one?  are we doing any action on that repository while merely creating a Python \"view\" of it?  Now with default `create=True` we don't have those guarantees\n", "closed_by": {"login": "bpoldrack", "id": 10498301, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDk4MzAx", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10498301?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bpoldrack", "html_url": "https://github.com/bpoldrack", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bpoldrack/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bpoldrack/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bpoldrack/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bpoldrack/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bpoldrack/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bpoldrack/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bpoldrack/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bpoldrack/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bpoldrack/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/218/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/218/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
