However, now `save()` can do it too: it runs `git annex add .` followed by `git add .` (based on my recommendation). The only use case that I can see where `install` is still required for adding content to a dataset is when file should be added to Git directly.\n\nNow the question: Really?\n\nThis implies that we cannot have untracked content by default with `save` (see --auto-add-changes=True). More general, it seems to communicate that we can have two ways of dealing with dataset changes:\n1. I don't give a fuck: `save -a`\n2. I am picky: `install <path>`, `save --no-a`\n\nNow that I have written that it seems less disturbing than before, but we should still be on the same page prior setting it in stone @bpoldrack @yarikoptic \n", "closed_by": {"login": "mih", "id": 136479, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjQ3OQ==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/136479?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih", "html_url": "https://github.com/mih", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/546/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/546/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
