Many small data bits are floating around like this, and having some kind of a one-liner to import them would make many things more accessible. From my POV the crawler does almost all needed things, but they aren't exposed via a convenience command. Here is what I currently think the features would need to be:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Have something like a `create-from-archive` command as a frontend for `create` and `crawler-init` that takes some form of URL (and/or regex like `uscan`), configures a fresh dataset for the crawler, crawls the archive file, does it usual crawling thing, and leaves the dataset ready to be updated at any time.\r\n- [ ] It shouldn't rival with the actual crawler functionality. If it is more than one URL, or more complicated scraping then a single \"grep\" of the HTML of a website is required, it should be considered out-of-scope and left to the crawler.\r\n- [ ] Have the ability to determine the version of an archive from something in the archive content, in case it cannot be found on the website, or the file name. This is something that seems not too uncommon from my packaging experience.\r\n- [ ] We should consider enhancing `update` to be able to trigger a re-crawl in addition to an update from standard remotes -- if all info is available.\r\n\r\n@yarikoptic Does that look sensible?\r\n\r\n", "closed_by": {"login": "mih", "id": 136479, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjQ3OQ==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/136479?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih", "html_url": "https://github.com/mih", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/1250/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/1250/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
