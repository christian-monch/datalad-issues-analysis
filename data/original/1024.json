In git, we have it to point to \"previous\" (or **1** up) commit.  So theoretically we could make it understand `^` (direct superdataset), `^^` (two super-datsets up), `^n` (n is a digit) - n superdatasets up (failing if there is no that many). \n\n But then what to choose for the ultimate super -- `^*`?\n\nIt will be backward incompatible since we did release already with current understanding of `^` but imho it is a tollerable breackage especially if we decide quick (I could implement).   alternatively \n- we could just use some other symbol to designate \"x level up\", e.g. \"~\" if to make git analogy, but it is somewhat bad since collides with \"$HOME\" (although unlikely anyone would use it that way)\n- we could maintain `^` as ultimate top super-dataset, while allowing for `^^`, `^^^` and `^n` to go prescribed number of supers up.  But then `^1` should be used for super 1 level up and it is somewhat inconsistent\n\nwhat do you think?\n", "closed_by": {"login": "mih", "id": 136479, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjQ3OQ==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/136479?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih", "html_url": "https://github.com/mih", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/1024/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/1024/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
