Currently, SSH is treated as god-given shell binary. My question is: what is our general development direction in this regard.\n1. Ignore. Currently implementation is unlikely to work on Windows (Mac OS I am not sure either) and we are OK with that.\n2. Acknowledge partially and ignore for now. We create a minimall SSH wrapper class that we use in our code base to secure a better chance to support SSH better in the future with justifiable effort.\n3. Switch to using a proper Wrapper like http://www.paramiko.org or https://github.com/mwilliamson/spur.py (both in Debian) hoping that they bring some improvement in cross platform support.\n", "closed_by": {"login": "mih", "id": 136479, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjQ3OQ==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/136479?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih", "html_url": "https://github.com/mih", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/417/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/417/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
