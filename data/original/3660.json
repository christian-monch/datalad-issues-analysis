It sits on top of the drop-py2 branch (gh-3629).\r\n\r\nI've run some tests locally, but I haven't checked that the whole suite passes.  If those pass, hopefully this can serve as a base to start plugging into some benchmarks.\r\n\r\nOne thing to note is that running test_gitrepo.py (and probably other tests) leads to a flood of `BlockingIOError` messages, though the tests still pass.  There's a bit more information about that in the [notes][0] of the temporary tip commit.\r\n\r\nEdit: Also, as the failing AppVeyor tests indicate, Windows needs special consideration: https://ci.appveyor.com/project/mih/datalad/builds/27322011/job/872d49m3kubwiqg8\r\n\r\n[0]: https://github.com/datalad/datalad/blob/8a1780defeca1e2b67cdb072989dcd0b23697212/runner-asyncio-notes.org#L2\r\n\r\nRe: #3262\r\n", "closed_by": {"login": "kyleam", "id": 1297788, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTc3ODg=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1297788?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam", "html_url": "https://github.com/kyleam", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/3660/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/3660/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
