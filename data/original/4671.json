Only the actual file transfer/auth is different. It would make sense to centralize the common code.\r\n\r\nI wonder, whether time has come to split off an actual datalad-core package that is lean and can serve this purpose. This aspect came up multiple times before in different contexts (core repo classes, core API, ...).\r\nA complication: While `git-remote-rclone` is really standalone, `datalad-osf` is much more integrated. Having both depend on datalad proper will force a whole slew of pointless dependencies.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/4671/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/4671/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
