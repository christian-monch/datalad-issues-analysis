localhost and ssh to 2221. so it would be easy to play/test with webfrontend and publishing more safely.\nas a part of it, on elderly systems it would symlink git-annex-standalone's git into usr/local/bin/ since otherwise we can't test `datalad ls` since we want freshish git.\n\nalong the way fixed up \n- creation of hooks directory (somehow was not created somehow although repo was initialized)\n- permissions to index.html\n- depth first running of hooks (so all the meta information properly bubbles up upon 'reconfigure' action)\n\nquick review/merge would be appreciated\n",
