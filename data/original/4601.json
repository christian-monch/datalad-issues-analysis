I went on your website looking for a community and found this github.\r\n\r\nI wanted to make sure you knew about the NeuroTechX community of brain hackers, researchers, and hobbyists.  There are literally thousands of people across the world on their slack; the form to join is at https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfZyzhVdOLU8_oQ4NylHL8EFoKLIVmryGXA4u7HDsZpkTryvg/viewform and their website is at \r\nhttps://neurotechx.com/ .\r\n\r\nI hung out on neurotechx some years ago and there was no mention of datalad.  People were actually starting their own, smaller projects to open source their brain research data, at that time.
