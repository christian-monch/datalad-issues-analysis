The latter needs should be required to store all annexed files.\r\nThis is how they are created:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndatalad.api.create_sibling_github(\r\n    name = 'origin',\r\n    reponame = os.path.basename(ds.path),\r\n    dataset = ds,\r\n    github_organization = 'X',\r\n    access_protocol = 'ssh',\r\n    private = True\r\n)\r\n\r\ndatalad.api.create_sibling(\r\n    name = 'cluster',\r\n    dataset = ds,\r\n    target_url = url,\r\n    publish_depends = 'origin',\r\n    annex_wanted = 'include=*'\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo changes can be published through:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ndatalad publish --to cluster\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut I'd like to know if this can be improved:\r\n - what if someone does `datalad publish --to github` instead of cluster ? How to make it so that cluster will be pushed to as well ? I thought I could set publish_depends = 'cluster' on the github sibling, but this results in an infinite loop when publishing.\r\n - Is there anyway to make `datalad publish` (without any argument) publish to \"cluster\" by default ?\r\n - Is there anyway to embed the `cluster` sibling configuration in the `github` sibling, so that when the user installs the dataset from github, he can just `datalad get --from cluster` without configuring the `cluster` sibling ? \r\n\r\n\r\n#### What version of DataLad are you using (run `datalad --version`)? On what operating system (consider running `datalad wtf`)?\r\n\r\n0.14.0\r\n\r\n#### Is there anything else that would be useful to know in this context?\r\n\r\n#### Have you had any success using DataLad before? (to assess your expertise/prior luck.  We would welcome your testimonial additions to https://github.com/datalad/datalad/wiki/Testimonials as well)\r\n\r\nYes, and it is very handy.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/5408/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/5408/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
