I think registry should include that information and then any particular website deployment should have somewhere (top level .git/config?) settings to which services to enable.  But with that enabled we already have support for redirecting for any file we host to bioimagesuiteweb ([visit example](https://bioimagesuiteweb.github.io/webapp/overlayviewer.html?image=https://datasets.datalad.org/labs/haxby/raiders/derivatives/openfmrilayout-qa-defacing/defacing/alldefaced.nii.gz&overlay=https://datasets.datalad.org/labs/haxby/raiders/derivatives/openfmrilayout-qa-defacing/defacing/alldefaced_mean.nii.gz)).\r\n\r\nSo if we establish such registry, then any e.g. .nii.gz file could have a context menu pop up with \"Single View on bisweb\".\r\n\r\nIf web interface could support selection of multiple files, or adding them into some kind of a \"queue\", we could add action for multiple like \"Overlay View on bisweb\", etc.  ", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/4476/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/4476/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
