It occurred to me that one standard workflow I use Git for is not possible solely with DataLad:\r\n\r\nPush a new, local branch (and only that branch) to a sibling (i.e., what I would use ``git push -u <remote><branch>`` for.\r\n\r\nI wanted to raise the question on whether such a functionality would be desired. I'm myself more or less indifferent about it - my take is that anyone who would make use of such a workflow probably knows how to do it with Git, and I only very rarely use branches in my datasets. I'm just planning to write about ``push`` in detail and outline what is possible and what is not, so it would help to know if not being able to do what's described above is a conscious decision. :)", "closed_by": {"login": "yarikoptic", "id": 39889, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjM5ODg5", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39889?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic", "html_url": "https://github.com/yarikoptic", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/4312/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/4312/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
