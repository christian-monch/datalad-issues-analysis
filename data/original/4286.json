Installation of git-annex across platforms remains an issue - with conda packaging efforts things improved, but not solved across platforms.\r\nSo I think through an idea to at least consider providing a GitAnnex class \"implementation\" providing only a few interfaces (e.g. `get` and `drop`) which we would implement for the most typical types of data access -- from a proper git remote via ssh or http (we can do it) or from URLs.  We will not bother with `annex init` or even being \"considerate\" about problems with adjusted branches/smudge filtering and what git would start thinking about having a large file appearing inplace of a symlink - we would just `get` file content into the `.git/annex/objects/...` if file is a real symlink, or inplace if file is on a crippled file system.\r\n\r\nSure thing a big fat warning would be issued such as  \r\n\r\n**WARNING!!! No git-annex found installed.  DataLad is operating in minimalistic \"consumer\" mode and only basic commands (clone, install, get, drop, remove, uninstall) are available on git-annex repositories.  You are strongly encouraged to install git-annex for proper functioning.  You might need to reinstall datasets which you installed in this minimalistic mode**\r\n\r\nSure thing warning could be made suppressed with some datalad config setting.\r\nIf we find no way to `get` a file without requiring `git-annex` we would also issue an informative error message for that file.\r\n\r\nBut otherwise -- it should make it possible to just `pip install datalad` on any system and `install/get` data from the majority of datasets we share or care about.
