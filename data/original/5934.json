Therefore it cannot be\r\nrelied on for critical messaging of _results_. Consequently, result\r\nrenderers perform their own messaging, ultimately leading to\r\ndouble-reporting of errors and warnings in many default setups (see\r\ngh-3752). Moreover, higher-level commands may later act on non-OK\r\nresults with recovery or mitigation actions. In such cases an\r\nunconditional (prominent) logging of results emitted by a lower-level\r\ncommand can be undesirable, but it is presently impossible to disable\r\nfrom a calling command.\r\n\r\nThis change alters the requirements for result renderers to assume the\r\nsole responsibility for visualizing (or not) any and all results that are\r\npassed to them, without being able to rely on a particular logging\r\nbehavior.\r\n\r\nIt is unknown in how many edge cases critical messages will disappear\r\nwith this change. However, @mih has been running with\r\n`datalad.log.result-level=debug` since Oct 2019, and has not noticed\r\nundesirable behavior (or fixed it).\r\n\r\nFixes datalad/datalad#5910", "closed_by": {"login": "mih", "id": 136479, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjQ3OQ==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/136479?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih", "html_url": "https://github.com/mih", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/5934/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/5934/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
