It doesn't even use properly managed calls to git commands. Key difference between `rev-diff` and `diff` is that the former yields a data structure that is highly similar to that produced by `rev-status` (which should aid adding `--since` to commands that already use `rev-status` internally). Moreover, instead of calling `git diff` it used the same underlying code as `rev-status` and determines differences based on pretty fast `ls-files/ls-tree` calls.\r\n\r\nGiven the limited use of `diff` in -core, and its sorry state, I think it is worth considering a hard replacement:\r\n\r\n- Expose `rev-diff` as `diff` immediately\r\n- RF internal usage by `publish`, `annotate-paths`, `rerun` to either use a then purely internal version of the old `diff`, or the new `diff` right away.\r\n\r\nThis issue has a relatively low priority. `rev-diff` is likely the least tested of the key -revolution commands, and it is least clear whether its current behavior is optimal wrt all potentially relevant applications.\r\n\r\nCheck status of https://github.com/datalad/datalad/issues/3192 for placement in -core.", "closed_by": {"login": "kyleam", "id": 1297788, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTc3ODg=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1297788?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam", "html_url": "https://github.com/kyleam", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/3190/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/3190/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
