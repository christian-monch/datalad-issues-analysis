IMHO we better operate slower but correctly.\r\n\r\nThis is my 2nd attempt (see https://github.com/datalad/datalad/compare/master...yarikoptic:bf-save-u if interested, but that one was 'shortsighted' although I have spent probably half a day on it learning intricacies of the save), and I did try to keep it minimal.  While at it I have fixed the tests which still hoped to get stuff automagically added.  I guess we are to introduce '-a' option back sooner than later ;-)\r\n\r\nBut while analyzing the 'save', I was converging on an idea that we might not need/want '-u' since we will not be able to provide consistent interface.  Please see the newly added 'save' spreadsheet in the API Use-cases convergence google doc.  E.g. SUC6.  So I am starting to wonder if we should just always save all staged and non-staged (but tracked) changes?\r\n\r\nUnlikely I will be up whenever the tests fail, so if you could contribute to fixing them -- would be most welcome!\r\nCloses #1419\r\n\r\nFTR  Joey agreed that having 'annex add -u' is sensible thus there is http://git-annex.branchable.com/todo/annex_add___40__-u__124__--update__41___mode/ now  but probably will not happen right away, thus this solution might still be sensible for now", "closed_by": {"login": "yarikoptic", "id": 39889, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjM5ODg5", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39889?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic", "html_url": "https://github.com/yarikoptic", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/1420/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/1420/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
