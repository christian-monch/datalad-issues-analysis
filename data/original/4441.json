Preliminary\r\ncheck seems to point toward newer dcm2niix.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if extensions, where matters, could check for their\r\nexternals and possibly even register them within our \"central\"\r\nExternalVersions checker.  This is what `add` effectively does.  Also\r\nfor regular python modules, it would pretty much just allow to add\r\nthem to \"INTERESTING\" list - displayed by dumps.\r\n\r\nI have positioned it against maint for now since it would allow extensions to use this feature sooner than later, and it is largely a minor enhancement which should not have negative side-effects (I hope ;)).
