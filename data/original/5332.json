The default is \"http https ftp\".\r\n> Think very carefully before changing this; there are security implications. For example, if it's changed to allow \"file\" URLs, then anyone who can get a commit into your git-annex repository could git-annex addurl a pointer to a private file located outside that repository, possibly causing it to be copied into your repository and transferred on to other remotes, exposing its content.\r\n\r\nThis change introduces a global HTTP server `datalad.test_http_server`\r\nthat is persistently available at test runtime. It could be used to\r\nreplace all usage of file:// URLs with http:// URLs. However, in the\r\nscope of this change, only git-annex related usage is modified, but\r\nthe use of file:// URLs for Git (submodules) is kept. Argueably, those\r\nare more relevant in practice.\r\n", "closed_by": {"login": "mih", "id": 136479, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjQ3OQ==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/136479?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih", "html_url": "https://github.com/mih", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/5332/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/5332/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
