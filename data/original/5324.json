I believe this approach would require modifying `datalad/datalad/distribution/create_sibling_github.py` and `datalad/datalad/support/github.py` to accept and utilize an additional parameter.\r\n\r\n#### What version of DataLad are you using (run `datalad --version`)? On what operating system (consider running `datalad wtf`)?\r\nDatalad version 0.13.7 on Mac OS Catalina 10.15.7.\r\n\r\n#### Is there anything else that would be useful to know in this context?\r\nNothing else to note.\r\n\r\n#### Have you had any success using DataLad before? (to assess your expertise/prior luck.  We would welcome your testimonial additions to https://github.com/datalad/datalad/wiki/Testimonials as well)\r\nI love Datalad! To make sure that this issue was not user error on my part, I tried `datalad create-sibling-github` on my personal account, which worked perfectly, so I am pretty certain the issue is with the requesting URL to github.\r\n", "closed_by": {"login": "mih", "id": 136479, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjQ3OQ==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/136479?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih", "html_url": "https://github.com/mih", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/5324/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/5324/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
