I noticed there is something like `git annex fsck` but not sure how to apply it recursively and print only missing content (it prints a huge list of `ok` files).\r\n\r\nTo clarify, I need the content to be within the dataset, I don't care if a copy is available elsewhere. I am trying to check if the master location has all the files and I did not miss anything when merging updates from other locations.\r\n\r\n#### What steps will reproduce the problem?\r\nNA\r\n\r\n#### What version of DataLad are you using (run `datalad --version`)? On what operating system (consider running `datalad wtf`)?\r\n0.12.2 (installed from github, how do I find the installed hash?)\r\n\r\n#### Is there anything else that would be useful to know in this context?\r\nNA\r\n\r\n#### Have you had any success using DataLad before?
