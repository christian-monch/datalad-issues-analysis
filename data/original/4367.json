Gets enabled, I can obtain data - all good. Now I clone it from that clone to a third location. Special remote isn't autoenabled, while `git annex init` will do it. Nevertheless I have a git-annex branch and a filled `.git/annex` before that `annex-init` call.\r\n\r\nWhat's happening is, that we discover from within `clone`, that there is that original `origin` which we add to the clone of the clone as well as `origin-2` and try to enable it to figure its UUID. This `git-annex enableremote` call is done right before we check whether we need to `git-annex-init` the fresh clone and now it looks already initialized to us, since we find a local git-annex branch and everything. Therefore we don't call `git-annex-init`.\r\n\r\nTrying to fix this by simply change the order of things. A possible need for `annex-init` should be considered before anything else, I think.", "closed_by": {"login": "kyleam", "id": 1297788, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTc3ODg=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1297788?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam", "html_url": "https://github.com/kyleam", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/4367/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/4367/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
