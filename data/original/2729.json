That is great, but also adds toll on import time and also the \"length\" of the list of the commands etc.  I wondered if we should add support and RF for \"two level\" commands, e.g. instead of `datalad containers-run` after installation of `datalad-containers` (see datalad/datalad-container#48) we would get `datalad containers run`.\r\n\r\nThat later could be adopted for RFing `aggregate-metadata` into `metadata aggregate`, `extract-metadata` into `metadata extract`, `create-sibling` -> `siblings create` etc  to make whole cmdline api more sensible\r\n\r\nAt Python level, such an API could also go through attributes of the (composite) command class, where `__call__()` would do what it does now (e.g. for `siblings`) and then submethods would implement their own commands:\r\n`metadata.aggregate`, `metadata.extract`, `siblings.create` ", "closed_by": {"login": "mih", "id": 136479, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjQ3OQ==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/136479?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih", "html_url": "https://github.com/mih", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/2729/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/2729/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
