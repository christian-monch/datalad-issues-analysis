If we remove a direct subdataset, should `remove` remove the aggregate metadata for it too. if so, then any remove requires a traversal upwards to adjust superdataset content beyond the `save` of the subdataset change (which it is already recording).\r\n\r\nIf we do it for datasets, what about files?
