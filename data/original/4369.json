I think doing a datalad publish/push should be sufficient for this. Two questions:\r\n1. Does the remote server need to have datalad or git/git-annex installed, or is my local datalad sufficient just to push files and set the correct file permissions in the remote?\r\n2. Is this the best way to do the backup, or do you suggest something else? I was doing backups via rclone before, but I lose file permissions in the remote, and it would not be a usable datalad backup until I restore files via rclone.\r\n\r\n#### What steps will reproduce the problem?\r\nNA\r\n\r\n#### What version of DataLad are you using (run `datalad --version`)? On what operating system (consider running `datalad wtf`)?\r\n0.12.4\r\n\r\n#### Is there anything else that would be useful to know in this context?\r\nI checked the documentation a bit, looks like RIA is not what I need.\r\n\r\n#### Have you had any success using DataLad before? (to assess your expertise/prior luck.  We would welcome your testimonial additions to https://github.com/datalad/datalad/wiki/Testimonials as well)\r\nSure.", "closed_by": {"login": "yarikoptic", "id": 39889, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjM5ODg5", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39889?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic", "html_url": "https://github.com/yarikoptic", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/4369/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/4369/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
