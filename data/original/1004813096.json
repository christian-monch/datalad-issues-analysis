There were a lot of other errors initially, which were sorted out by pulling in the non-core dependencies from the downloaders and metadata sections. Is there a way to only run the test suite for core functionality?\r\n3. Is there a way to sandbox the test suite so that it works without outbond connectivity, or barring that turn off all the test functions which require network access?\r\n4. There's a number of non-python dependencies (obviously) not covered in `setup.py`. One is clearly `git-annex`, and an other is `p7zip`.
