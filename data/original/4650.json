The idea with that test is to get an idea of what our functional minimal version is at this point, regardless of whether we choose a higher floor.  I chose v2.13.0 because it is the earliest version that I didn't find issues with when testing locally.\r\n\r\n  https://travis-ci.org/github/datalad/datalad/builds/701074711\r\n\r\n- [x] Decide where to introduce the minimal version.  As I mentioned in gh-4636, I'd prefer not to introduce a hard floor in a bug fix release, as it runs the risk of making datalad not work at all for users where a subset of functionality may have been working fine.  And we've gone a long time without specifying a minimum requirement.\r\n\r\n  My current thinking is that we should target this series for 0.13.1.  Instead of aborting if an unsupported version is detected, we should just tell the user via `warnings.warn` that v2.19.1 (or whatever version we end up deciding to go with) is the oldest version we test against.  If their version is below v2.13.0, we might want to give a bit stronger warning, given there are known issues at that point.\r\n\r\n  Then, on the master branch (so targeting 0.14), we can switch the warning over to the `external_versions.check` call that is currently in this PR.\r\n\r\n\r\n[0]: https://travis-ci.org/github/datalad/datalad/builds/701067382\r\n", "closed_by": {"login": "kyleam", "id": 1297788, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTc3ODg=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1297788?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam", "html_url": "https://github.com/kyleam", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/4650/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/4650/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
