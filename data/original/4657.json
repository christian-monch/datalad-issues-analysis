This works as intended when using\r\ninstall() to get an existing dataset or using clone() to create a new\r\nsubdataset, but the parent's configuration is ignored when the clone\r\nis triggered by get().\r\n\r\nThe \"inherit reckless\" logic is handled in Clone.__call__(), but\r\nthat's upstream of clone_dataset(), where get() hooks into.  Move the\r\nhandling into clone_dataset() to avoid repeating it in get().\r\n\r\nNote that we don't have access to the parent dataset in\r\nclone_dataset(), but we need to query its configuration.  We could add\r\nthe parent dataset as a parameter.  However, there's already a cfg\r\nparameter, and Clone.__call__()---the only caller that specifies\r\ncfg---passes the parent's configuration.  So instead just update get()\r\nto pass in cfg and query that, adjusting the documentation to note\r\nthat cfg should be the parent's.\r\n```\r\n\r\nCloses #4655.\r\n", "closed_by": {"login": "mih", "id": 136479, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjQ3OQ==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/136479?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih", "html_url": "https://github.com/mih", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/4657/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/4657/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
