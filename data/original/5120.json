I am offered `--cfg-proc` for this purpose, which allows for running any known procedure on this newly created dataset (and a lack of procedure discoverability is #4803). However, I cannot make `addurls` pass parameters to this procedure, because it sits on top of `create --cfg-proc` which itself cannot take arguments.\r\n\r\nOne approach to parameterize config procedures would be to enhance `create` and `addurls` to pass arguments. However, this might get ugly quickly, in terms of its impact on the cmdline APIs of both commands.\r\n\r\nAnother approach would be to leave a trace of the \"context\" a config procedure is running it, such that a procedure can internally look up a related (super)dataset and inspect its configuration. In the context of `create` the immediate superdataset is relevant, but when `create` runs the config procedure, this parent dataset is easily discoverable from within the procedure (`.get_superdataset()`).\r\n\r\nThe situation is different for addurls. This command may create several levels of subdatasets, while there is no guarantee that `addurls` itself is executed on the topmost dataset in a hierarchy. One way to mitigate here would be if `addurls` leaves a trace of its working dataset in the environment. For example, it could set DATALAD_ADDURLS_ROOTDS to the respective absolute path. In the context of a config procedure, this config setting would become automatically and rather conveniently accessible in the ConfigManager of the to-be-configured dataset, and this root dataset could be consulted for any relevant configuration.\r\n\r\nPing @loj -- this is the missing feature that should help initiallize XNAT subject subdatasets.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/5120/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/5120/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
