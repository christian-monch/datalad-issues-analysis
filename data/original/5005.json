This approach allows us to maintain any error message inspection, because these commit calls are unchanged. The interactive edit is a pure add-one, that is only attempted if anyhow possible. It should also not fail in ways that it would not have failed in the previous commit call.\r\n\r\nBased on the feedback in gh-4121, the default (non-interactive) behavior\r\nis unchanged. Trigger the interactive behavior via:\r\n\r\n`datalad -c datalad.save.no-message=interactive save`\r\n\r\nFixes gh-5004\r\n\r\nThe primary purpose of this change is to allow enabling in dev environments, in order to get practical experience with the interactive behavior in various scenarios (simple one-dataset save, up to complex hierarchical operations). The current concept on how to deal with these is datalad/datalad-revolution#71 (which should see practical validation, which is prepared with this change).
