Pros -- might be helpful even for non-datalad projects. Cons --  even more packaging/maintenance, version dependencies etc .\r\n\r\n\"uglyish\" (re)solutions could be:\r\n\r\nU1. migrate setup_support.py, formatters.py (and whatelse) under `datalad/support/` in the main code base, so we could just import them as a file within main codebase setup.py, while all dependent extensions could properly import from `datalad.support.setup`?\r\nU2. setup a \"datalad-core-base\" repository which would keep those files and possibly README.md with some common sections (Acknowledgement?), which we keep merging (if common change is needed) within all \"official\" repositories\r\n\r\nWhat do you think @datalad/developers ?\r\n", "closed_by": {"login": "mih", "id": 136479, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjQ3OQ==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/136479?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih", "html_url": "https://github.com/mih", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/2404/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/2404/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
