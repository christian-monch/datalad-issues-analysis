This came to attention after solving #1850.\r\n\r\nThis does't mean the bugfix did sth wrong, but tests made assumptions before, that are actually invalid. What the missing initialization leads to is:\r\nWe clone a testrepo to use that clone with a test and in that test we might clone it again (via `install` for example). Now without initialization neither the resulting repository has an `git-annex` branch nor does its remote 'origin'. However, if we are in direct mode, we do have a trace of an annex, since the cloned branch isn't 'master', but 'annex/direct/master'. Therefore it now differs whether or not a `Dataset`'s `repo` is an instance of `GitRepo` or `AnnexRepo`. Some tests were written in a way, that they (implicitly) expect a `GitRepo` when it actually should be an `AnnexRepo` and are now failing in direct mode.\r\nI don't know the extend yet or how much new failings an `annex-init` in that `clone_url()` will result in.\r\nHowever, I'm working on it, since this is not just a direct mode issue, but an issue with invalid assumptions in the tests. The very same thing is likely to happen if we consider using v6-adjusted-branch testrepos for example.\r\nIf you have further thoughts on this, let me know, @datalad/developers .
