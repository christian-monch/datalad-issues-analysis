This PR adds the additional rule to not regard empty files (mimetype ``inode/x-empty``) as a largefile to the ``.gitattributes`` configuration ``cfg_text2git`` provides.\r\nAdditionally, it adds a small test for this.\r\n\r\nIt's WIP because I want to see whether any test fail as @kyleam noted in #3663:\r\n\r\n> I suppose one tricky part about testing cfg_text2git is that the behavior depends on git-annex being built with the MagicMime flag. But assuming MagicMime support should be fine because neurodebian's git-annex has it and it looks like conda's does now too. If it ends up being a problem down the road, we can skip the test based on the git annex version output.", "closed_by": {"login": "kyleam", "id": 1297788, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTc3ODg=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1297788?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam", "html_url": "https://github.com/kyleam", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/3667/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/3667/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
