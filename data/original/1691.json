We added a new subdataset and want to publish the entire beast. The issue here is, that we didn't install all the other subdatasets of `///`. Actually it's working (meaning: it publishes what is  expected), but returns non-zero, since the recursive publishing of the superdataset yields `impossible` for all the not installed subdatasets.\r\nWe have no nice and obvious way to avoid that. `datalad publish` itself provides a `--missing=skip` option, but this one is for missing siblings to publish to, not for locally absent subdatasets. I guess we need an additional option here. Do you agree, @datalad/developers ?\r\n\r\nAn ugly approach to make the test pass would be to use `--on-failure=ignore`, but this is bad for a test, since we can't specify the failure we want to ignore. Furthermore it doesn't work in this case.", "closed_by": {"login": "bpoldrack", "id": 10498301, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDk4MzAx", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10498301?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bpoldrack", "html_url": "https://github.com/bpoldrack", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bpoldrack/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bpoldrack/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bpoldrack/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bpoldrack/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bpoldrack/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bpoldrack/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bpoldrack/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bpoldrack/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bpoldrack/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/1691/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/1691/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
