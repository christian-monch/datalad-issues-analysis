With #1350 we now have a general switch for all (new-style) commands to enable rendering (and render format selection at the same time) on a by-call basis. Additionally, general rendering behavior can be configured via a cfg option, as well as via a cmdline switch. This will have two consequences:\r\n\r\n1. the \"underscore\" function will vanish from the API -- they only provide a subset of the functionality, and they pollute the documentation with hard-to-filter duplicates -- their time has come....\r\n2. the Command classes' output rendering helpers will need to get RF'ed. The interface stays conceptually the same (now advertised as a \"tailored\" rendering mode -- as opposed to the generic ones that work for any command in the same way), however, we will stop passing argparse objects, and instead use the kwargs of the actual command function call.\r\n\r\nThis RF will be a rather slow process that takes place one command at a time, whenever its conversion to using the `eval_results` decorator happens.", "closed_by": {"login": "mih", "id": 136479, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjQ3OQ==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/136479?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih", "html_url": "https://github.com/mih", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/1362/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/1362/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
