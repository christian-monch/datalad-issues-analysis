The old setup is fully removed and a new one is put in place -- with the hope that it is more structured, and easier to maintain. Key features:\r\n\r\n- (almost) full set of tests on Windows, Linux, and MacOS tests (incl SSH connectivity)\r\n- possibility for interactive debugging for all CI runs enabled by default\r\n- per CI-run configurable Python version (a consistent 3.8 at the moment)\r\n- `datalad-installer` integration for flexible deployment of git-annex variant (see examples inside)\r\n- ability to install \"system packages\" via apt or homebrew by simply listing their names\r\n- Test run environment configured to have reasonably short path names (to avoid mysterious glitches from such failures)\r\n- coverage submission for all platforms\r\n- retains all log files (at least for now) so linking them in issues is meaningful (unlike with github actions). Exhibit A: [First ever appveyor run](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/mih/datalad/build/1.0.1)\r\n\r\nThe test suite is split into 9 separate runs across all platforms. Each run aims for a duration of ~30min to leave time for debugging without extra fiddling. When appveyor is paid in full (10 workers), this should give a turn-around latency of <45min.\r\n\r\nIn order to get here (and the expansion of the windows tests in particular) I had to make a number of fixes (split into dedicated commits). The most notable is the discontinuation of the `with_testrepos` decorator (and associated machinery) in the tests of core functionality.\r\n\r\nThere are still a few tests failing. I have filed dedicated issues for them:\r\n\r\n- [x] `git-annex cannot create directory` #5291 (osx)\r\n- [x] `datalad.support.tests.test_parallel.test_gracefull_death` #5296 (win)\r\n- [x] `datalad.distribution.tests.test_create_sibling.test_target_ssh_simple` #5298 (linux)\r\n- [x] `datalad.cmdline.tests.test_main.test_help_np` #5299 (osx)\r\n- [x] `datalad.plugin.tests.test_plugins.test_no_annex` #5300 (win)\r\n- [x] `datalad.customremotes.tests.test_archives.test_basic_scenario` #5301 (osx)\r\n- [x] `datalad.distributed.tests.test_ria_basics.test_remote_layout` #5302 (osx)\r\n\r\nIn order to be able to use the RDP connection to the windows working, you will need a password that I will provide. For the SSH connection, you will need a dedicated SSH private key. Using dedicated aliases makes the connection relatively simple. I suggest:\r\n\r\n```\r\nalias appveyor_rdp=\"xfreerdp /cert:ignore /dynamic-resolution /u:appveyor /p:PASSWORDFROMME\"\r\nalias appveyor_ssh=\"ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_KEYFROMME_rsa -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith these two, one can log in with the credentials shown at the (relatively) top of each CI run log. For example:\r\n\r\n```\r\n% appveyor_ssh appveyor@67.225.164.41 -p 22033\r\n\r\n% appveyor_rdp /v:67.225.164.53:33816\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen logging in, you can `touch BLOCK` (linux/mac), or `right-click-new-textfile-BLOCK[.txt]` (win) to block the worker from exiting -- up to the maximum run duration (60min). Please remove blocks in order to make slots free, as soon as you no longer need them.\r\n\r\nFTR: Here is the last CI run log from the repository I was working in: https://ci.appveyor.com/project/mih/appveyor-datalad/builds/37168575", "closed_by": {"login": "mih", "id": 136479, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjQ3OQ==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/136479?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih", "html_url": "https://github.com/mih", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/5303/reactions", "total_count": 4, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 1, "confused": 0, "heart": 1, "rocket": 1, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/5303/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
