Actually not even sure if --since is in effect since now that everything is published I still see it going through submodules and trying to push some data where data might needed to be pushed:\r\n```shell\r\n(git)smaug:/mnt/btrfs/datasets/datalad/crawl[master]\r\n$> datalad publish --to=datalad-public --missing=inherit -r\r\n[INFO   ] Publishing <Dataset path=/mnt/btrfs/datasets/datalad/crawl/workshops/nipype-2017/ds000114> data to datalad-public \r\n...\r\n$> datalad --version\r\ndatalad 0.5.1.dev95\r\n...\r\n```", "closed_by": {"login": "mih", "id": 136479, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjQ3OQ==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/136479?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih", "html_url": "https://github.com/mih", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/1495/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/1495/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
