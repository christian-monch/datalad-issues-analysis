It is unclear to me whether that is desirable. In my concrete use case, I am uploading files that shall be accessible by a webserver process. The UNIX umask server-side is set up in a way that sets the desired permissions for new files (660 in my case). However, uploading a 400 file via `scp` or `sftp`, retains the 400 permissions (even without `-p`).\r\n\r\nAn alternative approach would be to `touch` each upload server-side and then overwrite it with an upload. In this case the default permissions are inherited. This solves my problem, but I am unsure whether such behavior is desirable in the general case.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/5130/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/5130/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
