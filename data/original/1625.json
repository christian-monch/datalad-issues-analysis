It is functional, but not complete yet.\r\n\r\nChanges\r\n- [x] convert from standalone implementation into a datalad plugin\r\n- [x] make use of datalad's metadata extractors, instead of \"hand-parsing\" files (https://github.com/INCF/pybids/issues/85 is a showstopper for now)\r\n   - majority of the old code is concerned with assembling and merging metadata from various sources -- this is already done by datalad. The only thing left todo is to sort and group metadata by file type, and to format a nice table\r\n- [x] assay tables can be generated in the order desired by SciData\r\n- [x] support for multiple sources for a single assay table field (e.g. auto-amend BIDS from NIfTI header metadata)\r\n- [x] reinject ontology info for parameters and parameter values, source info is in place, but respective table columns have to be (re)created\r\n- [x] populate study and investigator info more completely, possibly using other metadata sources supported by datalad (including its own native metadata), absolutely straightforward for the author list\r\n- [x] some remaining issue with the term ref columns in the assay tables, some seem to get misplaced, check phase2 output for demo\r\n\r\nThis is now working as intended. Future changes will have to be:\r\n\r\n- stop relying on present `participants.tsv` file and use info from aggregated metadata -- requires conversion on metadata structure that nobody can afford right now\r\n- implement regression test on (multiple) real datasets -- will become possible (and cheap) once our own datasets carry new aggregated metadata", "closed_by": {"login": "mih", "id": 136479, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjQ3OQ==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/136479?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih", "html_url": "https://github.com/mih", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/1625/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/1625/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
