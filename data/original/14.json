Some datasets to be covered, such as HCP, are quite large.  E.g. S3 bucket of HCP for 500subjects release contains around 6,000,000 files.  Placing such datasets under git-annex can be challenging and points to bottlenecks in the setup.  This milestone is pre-requisit for initiating populating dataset handles. Before starting to generate target dataset handles which will be provided for public consumption it is important to evaluate and investigate possible modifications which could or should be done to git-annex to make it more efficient (and at times simply viable) for storing such datasets.\r\nMoreover, we would like to see if any other improvements necessary to be done on git-annex side to facilitate more efficient interaction between to be developed datalad side functionality (e.g. custom downloaders)", "creator": {"login": "yarikoptic", "id": 39889, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjM5ODg5", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39889?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic", "html_url": "https://github.com/yarikoptic", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yarikoptic/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "open_issues": 0, "closed_issues": 5, "state": "closed", "created_at": "2015-01-11T03:49:57Z", "updated_at": "2015-04-24T18:37:12Z", "due_on": "2015-01-31T08:00:00Z", "closed_at": "2015-04-24T18:37:12Z"}, "comments": 3, "created_at": "2014-10-15T13:35:05Z", "updated_at": "2015-01-21T11:32:38Z", "closed_at": "2015-01-21T11:32:38Z", "author_association": "MEMBER", "active_lock_reason": null, "body": "as discovered with https://github.com/hanke/studyforrest/issues/5\n\noriginally had read/write for owner/group,  was pushed to public server with that group missing\n\nI guess ideally git-annex could have an option for \"public\" publishing of the annex?\n", "closed_by": {"login": "mih", "id": 136479, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjQ3OQ==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/136479?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih", "html_url": "https://github.com/mih", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/14/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/14/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
