E.g. for URL regexp \"http.*.torrent\" still use built-in wget/curl for checking content presence and `aria2c %(url)s` for fetching the content.  Such custom downloaders would also have their registry of authorization credentials for data sources requiring them.  Also we could support extraction from locally present archives, via custom downloaders, see e.g. https://github.com/datalad/datalad/blob/54b71be5d514991aa432931564698744492bcb6c/docs/design.rst#L277 on details.\n\nIf support of custom downloaders would not be implemented directly in git-annex, it might be implementable by datalad in many cases by \"proxying\" calls to wget and/or curl and then checking/fetching content accordingly.\n\nCurrently annex only has support for regular wget/curl and quvi (for youtube videos), with hardcoded logic.\n\nRelated:\n- all issues tagged as new-datatransfer-protocol https://github.com/datalad/datalad/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Anew-datatransfer-protocol\n- Using an external client (addurl torrent support)\n  http://git-annex.branchable.com/todo/Bittorrent-like_features/#index2h1\n", "closed_by": {"login": "joeyh", "id": 16392, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE2Mzky", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16392?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/joeyh", "html_url": "https://github.com/joeyh", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joeyh/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joeyh/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joeyh/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joeyh/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joeyh/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joeyh/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joeyh/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joeyh/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joeyh/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/10/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/10/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
