The idea was, analogously to hooks, to provide at Python level entry points \"namespace\" so extensions could either register additional actions to be performed, or even to provide datalad core with additional \"choices\" (e.g. installation urls etc).\r\n\r\nAdding such facility to datalad core would facilitate\r\n\r\n- adding \"registry\" support for registering datasets: https://github.com/datalad/datalad-registry/issues/7\r\n\r\nThe difficulty/problem: IMHO it adds an additional \"API\" on top of the already \"fluid\" API where would need to regulate such entrypoints hooks -- on what args they would be provided and in some cases what they are supposed to return.  But I guess it would not be too radically different from what is already done in hooks.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/5289/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/5289/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
