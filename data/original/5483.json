There is also a \"training instance\" to develop against the service. It is integrated with \r\n[B2FIND](https://eudat.eu/services/userdoc/b2find-usage) and [B2ACCESS](https://eudat.eu/services/userdoc/b2access-usage)\r\n\r\nThe B2SHARE service is free of charge for European scientists and researchers. The service is professionally managed and data is safely preserved via a backup service, and a disaster recovery plan is available. There is also a connection to [B2DROP](https://eudat.eu/services/userdoc/b2drop) -- which is an interesting target on its own.\r\n\r\nThe B2SHARE service will be advanced on top of the existing features:\r\n\r\n- the basic B2SHARE service will be provided by multiple service providers,\r\n- communities can request a premium service,\r\n- larger storage capacity for the premium service,\r\n- service provisioning based on SLAs,\r\n- users can select their service provider of choice and trust, sharing data with user groups (extended restricted access),\r\n- social tagging.\r\n\r\nResearchers can use the service free of charge for small number of uploads and records, but B2SHARE is subject to a \"fair share\" principle. If you are a researcher or community that needs to create many records or has many (large) files, please contact us through the service request portal.\r\n\r\nCurrent limits:\r\n\r\n- no limit to the number of files\r\n- no limit on the number of records\r\n- 10GB per file and 20GB per record\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/136479/110758323-b1614780-824c-11eb-8d11-c7132f7f928f.png)\r\n(from https://www.eudat.eu/services/userdoc/b2share)\r\n\r\nB2SHARE is provided via EUDAT which is co-funded by the European Commission. EUDAT \u2013 European Data Infrastructure \u2013 is an initiative which is building a sustainable pan-European infrastructure for research data. It brings together a consortium of 25 partners, including national data and high performance computing (HPC) centres, technology providers, research communities, and research councils from 13 countries. EUDAT provides generic data services, such as storage and computing services to European researchers and research communities, and offer a joint metadata service integrating metadata from different communities into easily searchable and open catalogues. In the unlikely event that the B2SHARE service would draw to a close in the future, we guarantee to keep your data archived and accessible for at least 2 years and will assist in the migration of your data to other suitable repositories.\r\n\r\nThere is another interesting technical angle. From https://blog.zenodo.org/2017/05/30/doi-versioning-launched/\r\n\r\n> DOI versioning support was one of our most requested features for Zenodo, and it has been co-developed by OpenAIRE\u2019s Zenodo team and EUDAT\u2019s B2SHARE team as an extension module for CERN\u2019s Invenio digital repository platform, which powers both Zenodo and B2SHARE.\r\n\r\nSo the underlying platform is the same as Zenodo (#23).\r\n\r\nAnd there are also site-specific instances, such as https://b2share.fz-juelich.de/ (with different limits on uploads).", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/5483/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/5483/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
