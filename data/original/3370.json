Instead, the actually mandatory lines should be extended to identify them as run records, e.g.:\r\n\r\n  ```\r\n     ==CMD= Do not change lines below ===\r\n     ^^CMD^ Do not change lines above ^^^\r\n  ```\r\nor `s/CMD/RUN/g`. With this change it would be as convenient to discover such commit (via `git log`). Moreover, the subject line is now free to include other meaningful tags for human consumption.\r\n\r\nSuch a change would have minimal transition costs.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/3370/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/3370/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
