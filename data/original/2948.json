Therein `test_run.py:test_rerun_just_one_commit` fails, because `rerun` complains, that the original run record was ran from a different dataset. This is because the dataset id is in master and the test checks out an orphan branch to operate on. Now `rerun` compares the original dataset id to `None` (no `.datalad/config` in that branch) and fails. There's a little bit more details to that test failures regarding what is reevaluted at what point in time, but that's not the point.\r\n\r\nThe point is: Such branch would get a different dataset id than 'master' one way or another (including even no id at all unless `create` is also called on that branch). I think that's fine, since the orphan branch actually has no common history with master. But it might have weird side effects. What do you think - do we want it that way, @mih , @yarikoptic , @kyleam ? Otherwise datalad id needs to go into `.git/config` instead, I guess.\r\n", "closed_by": {"login": "bpoldrack", "id": 10498301, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDk4MzAx", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10498301?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/bpoldrack", "html_url": "https://github.com/bpoldrack", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bpoldrack/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bpoldrack/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bpoldrack/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bpoldrack/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bpoldrack/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bpoldrack/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bpoldrack/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bpoldrack/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/bpoldrack/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/2948/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/2948/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
