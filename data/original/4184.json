The data is 1.7Tb and is split in several subdatasets, total ~450 of which 440 are subject datasets in one of the bids folder. After merging some changes from another location, I am going back to the root superdataset to check if any subdataset is out of sync (i.e., the submodule registered in the parent dataset is not pointing to the last commit of the subdataset). I use `-e commit` to avoid thorough checks, but it takes almost 3 hours anyway:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[dorian@mri FEDERATED_DATASETS]$ time datalad status -e commit\r\nnothing to save, working tree clean\r\n\r\nreal    0m0.272s\r\nuser    0m0.203s\r\nsys     0m0.077s\r\n[dorian@mri FEDERATED_DATASETS]$ time datalad status -e commit --recursive\r\nnothing to save, working tree clean\r\n\r\nreal    169m26.862s\r\nuser    7m6.813s\r\nsys     8m17.664s\r\n```\r\nIs this normal? Is my command correct for simply checking proper registration of latest commit of each subdataset into parent?\r\n\r\n#### What steps will reproduce the problem?\r\nCan't tell how to reproduce, try on a big superdataset.\r\n\r\n#### What version of DataLad are you using (run `datalad --version`)? On what operating system (consider running `datalad wtf`)?\r\n0.12.2 (installed from github yesterday)\r\n\r\n#### Is there anything else that would be useful to know in this context?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n#### Have you had any success using DataLad before? (to assess your expertise/prior luck.  We would welcome your testimonial additions to https://github.com/datalad/datalad/wiki/Testimonials as well)\r\nYes.", "closed_by": {"login": "dorianps", "id": 9083517, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjkwODM1MTc=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9083517?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/dorianps", "html_url": "https://github.com/dorianps", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dorianps/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dorianps/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dorianps/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dorianps/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dorianps/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dorianps/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dorianps/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dorianps/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dorianps/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/4184/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/4184/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
