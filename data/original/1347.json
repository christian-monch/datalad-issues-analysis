Moreover, if those are specified, but even without `-g` (explicit `get data` option) we could then run `get --auto` to respect provided wanted settings and thus fetch files as needed/specified.  I guess then `datalad get` also could, whenever no custom PATHs specified, and wanted setting is set, call `annex get --auto` to fetch all the data this particular clone \"desires\" (currently would fail and demand a path)", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/1347/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/1347/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
