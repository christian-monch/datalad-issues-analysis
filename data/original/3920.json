That is inconsistent with how `remove` behaves with non-dataset items (unless `--nosave` is given).\r\n\r\n`remove` still uses annotated paths, so perhaps the most feasible fix is to just couple this with the rewrite to drop annotated paths from `remove`.  With 0.12.x, we've talked about moving away from most subcommands saving things themselves, and requiring a follow-up call to `save`, so going that direction would of course resolve this issue as well.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nHere's a script from #3919 that shows the issue:\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>script</summary>\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n#!/bin/sh\r\n\r\nset -eux\r\n\r\ncd $(mktemp -d --tmpdir dl-XXXXXXX)\r\ndatalad create\r\ndatalad create -d. subds\r\ndatalad remove --nocheck subds\r\ngit status\r\ndatalad status\r\n```\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n", "closed_by": {"login": "kyleam", "id": 1297788, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTc3ODg=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1297788?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam", "html_url": "https://github.com/kyleam", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kyleam/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/3920/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/3920/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
