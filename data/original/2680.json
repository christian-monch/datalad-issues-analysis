However, there are a few things that needs to polish:\r\n\r\n- the GIN webUI only offers \"GIN\" and \"SSH\" access (not sure if anonymous HTTP is intentionally unavailable). This means that DataLad users need to register, generate, and upload an SSH key to be able to `datalad install` from GIN. That seems needlessly complicated, but we might not be able to do anything about it at our end.\r\n\r\n- the \"public\" datasets use datacite as metadata standard (dataset-level), but in the YAML file format flavor. At present DataLad only understands the XML flavor.\r\n\r\n- some datasets contain the actual data files as ZIP archives (e.g. https://web.gin.g-node.org/bendalab/Henninger2017_electrosensory), maybe we can have a helper that sifts through such a dataset, and unpacks the archives (in the spirit of add-archive).\r\n\r\nNew dev contact is @achilleas-k\r\n\r\nTasks (from must-have to nice-to-have)\r\n\r\n- [x] enable read access to annex'ed files (see below for failure report)\r\n- [x] enable annex `copy --to` operations\r\n- [x] add CI test to make sure that datalad and GIN remain interoperable (we have approval to host small test datasets and access them for CI purposes)\r\n- [x] enable anonymous read access (see https://github.com/datalad/datalad/issues/2680#issuecomment-412152760)\r\n- [ ] enable programmatic creation of repos (analog to what we have for SSH server, GitHub and GitLab, ie. `create-sibling...`)\r\n- [ ] check what of the GIN client functionality we should wrap (or reimplement) to make it fit into datalad's API\r\n- [ ] check to which degree DataLad can work (and be advertised) as an alternative GIN client: https://gin.g-node.org/G-Node/Info/wiki/GinClientHelp", "closed_by": {"login": "mih", "id": 136479, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjQ3OQ==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/136479?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih", "html_url": "https://github.com/mih", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/2680/reactions", "total_count": 2, "+1": 2, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/2680/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
