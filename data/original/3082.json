In the case of `--explicit` run it might be necessary to `datalad add` only the files specified in `{outputs}`, not all the files. Since such a list could be prohibitively long to present in the log message, I wondered if we should support some way to provide a list of files to consider from a file for e.g. `add` or `save` command.\r\n\r\nSo I wondered if we should may be handle `filelist://` prefix to point to a file with filenames.  But then I thought that may be we could generalize it even further?  e.g. if we support \"list+\" prefix to any url, so `list+file://./.git/COMMIT_ADDFILES` would the take that local file, `install list+http://someurl/listofurls.txt` would download the list of urls from the `http://someurl/listofurls.txt` and consider them as the `path` input to `install`.  Similar handling could be useful for `download-url` as well.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?\r\n\r\n", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/3082/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/3082/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
