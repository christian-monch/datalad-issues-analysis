However, there is clearly a need for expanding this functionality (why shouldn't `create` be able to inherit information from a parent ds?). However, this comes at the cost of blowing up the API. Hence I propose to move all related functionality into a dedicated plugin that is capable of pulling down any relevant configuration from a parent ds. Such plugin can be configured to run prior/post any other command.\r\n\r\nMoreover, I propose to implement such a command in a way that it can perform its own (iterative, if needed) operations to enable arbitrary maneuvers -- such as always taking the template configuration from the very topmost dataset in a tree, or even a dedicated cfg template -- without having to interact or interfere with the particular nature of recursive processing done inside the actual command.", "closed_by": {"login": "mih", "id": 136479, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjQ3OQ==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/136479?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih", "html_url": "https://github.com/mih", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/1622/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/1622/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
