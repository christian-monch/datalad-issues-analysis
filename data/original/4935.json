This might be done via a dataset configuration procedure. Alternatively, we might decide to go privacy-by-default, and use salted annex keys and all the other stuff all the time (unless turned off).\r\n", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/4935/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/4935/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
