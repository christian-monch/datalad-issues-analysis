For some aspects we need a way to have conceptual documentation, that isn't tied to a particular command. In the issue above it is about some general concepts of metalad, but it would be useful for other extensions and some things in core, too.\r\n\r\nSo: Have a `help` command, that uses some extension \"entrypoint\" to provide a general help page for extensions. It should be possible to also allow for generating arbitrary topic pages. Like `datalad help extension-name`, but also `datalad help ria-store`, `datalad help ria-url`, `datalad help archives-special-remote`, etc.\r\n\r\nIdeally respective man pages would be rendered from that, too `man extension-name`, `man datalad-ria-store`, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat do you think, @datalad/developers?\r\n", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/5526/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/5526/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
