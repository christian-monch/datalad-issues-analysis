Usually, the way we distribute data is through USB hard drives. We do not use cloud services and do not have decent internet bandwidth to go online. I like to ask a few questions on this process, in case you can provide any tips.\r\n\r\n1. What is the best way to copy the data to the external HDD? Shall I `cd` inside the USB drive and do something like `datalad clone --get-data`? Perhaps a dumb way would be to `cp -L` and forget about datalad, which will make all symlinks as files, but this would lose the entire datalad advantage. To be clear, our collaborators know nothing about datalad, they are just expecting data from us. So we can't ask them to learn datalad. My understanding is that this is not a problem because from a user perspective the datasets would look just like folders with readable files in them. Moreover, I like the idea of version tagging the data we send out; this way researchers can check the version of the data they have with simple git/datalad commands.\r\n\r\n1. Some subdatasets I have are larger than the HDD storage capacity. So, I need to find a way to split the data (or sub-subdatasets) into multiple HDDs. Is there a way to do this easily or shall we just make up scripts that keep checking the remaining storage? But then how would the recipient of the data deal with putting back the data in a single dataset/folder?\r\n\r\n3. Lastly, this is more like an exercise, but let me ask since I am here. Let's suppose I have a parent dataset A and two subdatasets B1 and B2. I want to distribute B1 but not B2; better if  the data recipient does not notice at all the empty B2 folder. What is the best way to do this, shall I just clone A and manually `get` B1 under A while ignoring B2? Probably, B2 will still be in the config file, but at least would not be visible as an empty folder.\r\n\r\n#### What steps will reproduce the problem?\r\nNA\r\n\r\n#### What version of DataLad are you using (run `datalad --version`)? On what operating system (consider running `datalad wtf`)?\r\nI think I am at 0.13 now, can bring any version needed.\r\n\r\n#### Is there anything else that would be useful to know in this context?\r\nNA\r\n\r\n#### Have you had any success using DataLad before? (to assess your expertise/prior luck.  We would welcome your testimonial additions to https://github.com/datalad/datalad/wiki/Testimonials as well)\r\nWould not be here if I didn't. :)", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/4774/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/4774/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
