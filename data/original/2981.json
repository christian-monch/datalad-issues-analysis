Then jump back out to L1 and create a dataset that adds each of the sub datasets as submodules.\r\n\r\nAfter this I would like to use the new git-annex data caching feature to link the files in the sub-datasets to locations on the Web.\r\n\r\nis there a way to carry this workflow out.\r\n\r\nmore generally is there a datalad way of doing this for any arbitrary inside configuration of datasets? I place datalad datasets at any place in a tree. then at the top level i want to create a super dataset that adds any datalad dataset inside as submodule, but adds any non-annexed/non-git files to the super dataset. essentially an overlay of data.\r\n\r\ne.g. say i want to add nidm files to each repo, but i don't want them added to openneuro dataset, but create a reprobids dataset that adds these on.\r\n\r\n", "closed_by": {"login": "mih", "id": 136479, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjQ3OQ==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/136479?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih", "html_url": "https://github.com/mih", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mih/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/2981/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/datalad/datalad/issues/2981/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null}
